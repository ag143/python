## Getting started with front-end and back-end separation development

In traditional web application development, most programmers use the browser as the dividing line between the front and back ends. The part of the browser that displays the page for the user is called the front-end, and all the code that runs on the server to provide business logic and data preparation for the front-end is collectively called the back-end. The so-called front-end and back-end separation development means that the front-end and back-end engineers agree on the data interaction interface, and develop and test in parallel. The back-end only provides data and is not responsible for rendering the data on the page. The front-end obtains data through HTTP requests and is responsible for rendering the data. On the page, this work is handed over to the JavaScript code in the browser to complete.

There are many advantages to using front-end and back-end separation development. Let's briefly talk about these benefits:

1. **Improve development efficiency**. After the front-end and back-end are separated, the decoupling of the front-end and back-end code can be realized. As long as the front-end and back-end communicate and agree on the required interfaces and interface parameters of the application, parallel development can be started without waiting for the end of the development work of the other party. In this case, both front-end and back-end engineers can only focus on their own development work, which helps to build a better team. In addition, in the development mode where the front-end and back-end are separated, even if the requirements change, as long as the interface and data format remain unchanged, the back-end developers do not need to modify the code, as long as the front-end changes.
2. **Enhanced code maintainability**. After the front-end and back-end are separated, the code of the application is no longer a mixture of front-end and back-end. Only during the runtime will there be call dependencies. In this way, the work of maintaining the code will become much easier and more pleasant, and it will not affect the whole body. When your code becomes concise and clean, the readability and maintainability of the code will be qualitatively improved.
3. **Support multi-terminal and service architecture**. After the front-end and back-end are separated, the same set of data interfaces can provide services for different terminals, which is more helpful for building multi-terminal applications; in addition, since the interfaces provided by the back-end can be called through HTTP(S), it is helpful to create services. Architecture (including microservices).

Next, we will rewrite the previous voting application by separating the front and back ends.

### Returns data in JSON format

As mentioned earlier, in the development mode where the front-end and back-end are separated, the back-end needs to provide data interfaces for the front-end, and these interfaces usually return data in JSON format. In the Django project, we can process the object into a dictionary first, and then use the `JsonResponse` packaged by Django to return JSON-formatted data to the browser. The specific method is as follows.

````Python
def show_subjects(request):
    queryset = Subject.objects.all()
    subjects = []
    for subject in queryset:
        subjects.append({
            'no': subject.no,
            'name': subject.name,
            'intro': subject.intro,
            'isHot': subject.is_hot
        })
    return JsonResponse(subjects, safe=False)
````

In the above code, we loop through the `QuerySet` object obtained by querying subjects, process the data of each subject into a dictionary, save the dictionary in a list container named `subjects`, and finally use `JsonResponse` to complete Serialize the list and return the data in JSON format to the browser. Since `JsonResponse` serializes a list instead of a dictionary, you need to specify the value of the `safe` parameter to `False` to complete the serialization of `subjects`, otherwise a `TypeError` exception will be generated.

You may have discovered that it is more troublesome to write code to convert an object into a dictionary. If the object has many attributes and some attributes are associated with a more complex object, the situation will become even worse. To do this, we can use a third-party library called `bpmappers` to simplify the operation of converting objects into dictionaries. This third-party library itself also provides support for the Django framework.

Install the third-party library `bpmappers`.

```Shell
pip install bpmappers
````

Write a mapper (implementing object-to-dictionary conversion).

````Python
from bpmappers.djangomodel import ModelMapper

from poll2.models import Subject


class SubjectMapper(ModelMapper):
   
    class Meta:
        model = Subject
````

Modify the view function.

````Python
def show_subjects(request):
    queryset = Subject.objects.all()
    subjects = []
    for subject in queryset:
        subjects.append(SubjectMapper(subject).as_dict())
    return JsonResponse(subjects, safe=False)
````

Configure URL mapping.

````Python
urlpatterns = [
    
    path('api/subjects/', show_subjects),
    
]
````

Then access this interface, you can get the JSON format data as shown below.

````JSON
[
    {
        "no": 1,
        "name": "Python full stack + artificial intelligence",
        "intro": "Python is a computer programming language. It is an object-oriented dynamically typed language, originally designed for writing automation scripts (shells), with the continuous update of versions and the addition of new features of the language, the more It is increasingly being used in the development of independent, large-scale projects.",
        "is_hot": true
    },
    // The following content is omitted here
]
````

If you don't want to display the establishment time of the discipline in the JSON data, we can exclude the `create_date` property in the mapper; if you want to name the key corresponding to whether it is a popular discipline `isHot` (the default name is `is_hot`) , which can also be done by modifying the mapper. The specific method is as follows:

````Python
from bpmappers import RawField
from bpmappers.djangomodel import ModelMapper

from poll2.models import Subject


class SubjectMapper(ModelMapper):
    isHot = RawField('is_hot')

    class Meta:
        model = Subject
        exclude = ('is_hot', )
````

Look again at the JSON data returned by the discipline interface.

````JSON
[
    {
        "no": 101,
        "name": "Python full stack + artificial intelligence",
        "intro": "Python is a computer programming language. It is an object-oriented dynamically typed language, originally designed for writing automation scripts (shells), with the continuous update of versions and the addition of new features of the language, the more It is increasingly being used in the development of independent, large-scale projects.",
        "isHot": true
    },
    // The following content is omitted here
]
````

For the detailed usage guide of `bpmappers`, please refer to its [official document](<https://bpmappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>), this official document is written in Japanese, you can use the browser's The translation function translates it into a language you are familiar with.

### Rendering the page with Vue.js

Next, we use the front-end framework Vue.js to achieve page rendering. If you want to understand and learn Vue.js comprehensively, it is recommended to read its [official tutorial](<https://cn.vuejs.org/v2/guide/>) or on [YouTube](<https://www. Youtube.com/>) search for Vue.js novice tutorial (Vue.js Crash Course) to learn.

Rewrite the subjects.html page and use Vue.js to render the page.

````HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Discipline Information</title>
    <style>
/* Cascading style sheets are omitted here */
    </style>

<body>
    <div id="container">
        <h1>All subjects of Kouding Academy</h1>

    <script>
        let app = new Vue({
            el: '#main',
            data: {
                subjects: []
            },
            created() {
                fetch('/api/subjects/')
                    .then(resp => resp.json())
                    .then(json => {
                        this.subjects = json
                    })
            }
        })
    </script>
</body>
</html>

The development of front-end and back-end separation requires the deployment of front-end pages as static resources. When the project is actually online, we will separate the dynamic and static of the entire web application. The static resources are deployed through the Nginx or Apache server, and the Python program that generates dynamic content is deployed in uWSGI. Or on a Gunicorn server, requests for dynamic content are routed by Nginx or Apache to a uWSGI or Gunicorn server.

In the development stage, we usually use the test server that comes with Django. If you want to try to separate the front and back ends, you can first put the static pages in the previously created directory for placing static resources.
