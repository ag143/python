## Getting started with RESTful architecture and DRF

Turning software, platforms and infrastructures into services is something that many IT companies have been doing all the time. as a service) and IasS (Infrastructure as a Service). There are many ways to implement Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), including RPC (Remote Procedure Call), Web Service, REST, etc. At the technical level, SOA is an abstract, loosely coupled, coarse-grained software architecture. ; At the business level, the core concepts of SOA are "**reuse**" and "**interoperability**", which integrates system resources into operational, standard services that can be recombined and application. Among the many solutions for implementing SOA, REST is considered to be the most suitable architecture for Internet applications, and an architecture that conforms to the REST specification is often referred to as a RESTful architecture.

### REST overview

The term REST was coined by Roy Thomas Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000. Roy was the main designer of the HTTP protocol (versions 1.0 and 1.1), the main author of the Apache server software, and the first director of the Apache Foundation. Chairman. In his doctoral dissertation, Roy named his architectural principles for Internet software REST, the abbreviation of **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer, which is usually translated in Chinese as "**performance" Layer State Transition**" or "**Expression State Transition**".

The "presentation layer" here actually refers to the "presentation layer" of "resources". The so-called resource is an entity on the network, or a specific information on the network. It can be a piece of text, a picture, a song or a service. We can use a URI (Uniform Resource Locator) to point to a resource. To obtain this resource, just access its URI, which is the unique identifier of a resource on the Internet. Resources can have many external manifestations. The form in which we specifically present resources is called its "presentation layer". For example, text can be represented in `text/plain` format, `text/html` format, `text/xml` format, `application/json` format, and even in binary format; images can be represented in `image/ It can be expressed in jpeg` format or in `image/png` format. URI only represents the entity of the resource, not its representation. Strictly speaking, the `.html` suffix name at the end of some URLs is unnecessary, because this suffix name indicates the format and belongs to the category of "presentation layer", and URI should only represent the location of "resource", its specific expression, It should be specified with the `Accept` and `Content-Type` fields in the header of the HTTP request, which are the description of the "presentation layer".

Visiting a website represents an interactive process between the client and the server. In this process, data and state changes are bound to be involved. Web applications usually use HTTP as their communication protocol. If the client wants to operate the server, it must make a "state transfer" on the server side through an HTTP request. This transfer is based on the presentation layer, so it is the "presentation layer state". transfer". The client uses the HTTP verbs GET, POST, PUT (or PATCH), and DELETE to correspond to four basic operations on resources. GET is used to obtain resources, POST is used to create new resources (or update resources), and PUT (or PATCH) is used to update resources, and DELETE is used to delete resources.

Simply put, the RESTful architecture is: "Each URI represents a resource, and the client operates on the server-side resource through four HTTP verbs to realize the state transfer of the resource's presentation layer."

When we design web applications, if we need to provide resources to clients, we can use REST-style URIs, which is the first step in implementing a RESTful architecture. Of course, the real RESTful architecture is not just that the URI conforms to the REST style, but more importantly, the words "stateless" and "idempotent", we will explain these two points in the following courses. The following examples give some REST-style URIs for your reference when designing URIs.

| Request method (HTTP verb) | URI | Explanation |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | - ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GET** | `/students/` | Get all students |
| **POST** | `/students/` | Create a new student |
| **GET** | `/students/ID/` | Get student information with specified ID |
| **PUT** | `/students/ID/` | Update the information of the student with the specified ID (provide all the information of the student) |
| **PATCH** | `/students/ID/` | Update the information of the student with the specified ID (provide part of the student's information) |
| **DELETE** | `/students/ID/` | Delete student information with specified ID |
| **GET** | `/students/ID/friends/` | List all friends of the student with the specified ID |
| **DELETE** | `/students/ID/friends/ID/` | Delete the friend of the specified ID of the student with the specified ID |

### Getting Started with DRF

In the Django project, if you want to implement the REST architecture, that is, to publish the resources of the website as a REST-style API interface, you can use the well-known three-party library `djangorestframework`, which we usually call DRF for short.

#### Install and configure DRF

Install DRF.

```Shell
pip install djangorestframework
````

Configure DRF.

````Python
INSTALLED_APPS = [

    'rest_framework',
    
]

# The following configuration is set according to the needs of the project
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    # Configure default page size
    # 'PAGE_SIZE': 10,
    # Configure the default pagination class
    # 'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': '...',
    # configure exception handler
    # 'EXCEPTION_HANDLER': '...',
    # configure default parser
    # 'DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES': (
    # 'rest_framework.parsers.JSONParser',
    # 'rest_framework.parsers.FormParser',
    # 'rest_framework.parsers.MultiPartParser',
    # ),
    # Configure the default current limiting class
    # 'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': (
    # '...'
    # ),
    # Configure the default authorization class
    # 'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
    # '...',
    # ),
    # Configure the default authentication class
    # 'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
    # '...',
    # ),
}
````

#### Write the serializer

The development of front-end and back-end separation requires the back-end to provide API data interfaces for the front-end and mobile terminals, and API interfaces usually return data in JSON format, which requires serialization of model objects. DRF encapsulates the `Serializer` class and the `ModelSerializer` class to implement serialization operations. By inheriting the `Serializer` class or the `ModelSerializer` class, we can customize the serializer to process objects into dictionaries. The code is as follows shown.

````Python
from rest_framework import serializers


class SubjectSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):

    class Meta:
        model = Subject
        fields = '__all__'
````

The above code directly inherits `ModelSerializer`. The `model` attribute of the `Meta` class specifies the model to be serialized and the `fields` attribute specifies the model fields to be serialized, which we can use later in the view function. class to implement serialization of the `Subject` model.

#### Write the view function

The DRF framework supports two ways to implement the data interface, one is FBV (function-based view), and the other is CBV (class-based view). Let's first look at how the FBV method implements the data interface. The code is as follows.

````Python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response


@api_view(('GET', ))
def show_subjects(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    subjects = Subject.objects.all().order_by('no')
    # Create a serializer object and specify the model to serialize
    serializer = SubjectSerializer(subjects, many=True)
    # Obtain the dictionary corresponding to the model through the data attribute of the serializer and return the data in JSON format by creating a Response object
    return Response(serializer.data)
````

Compared with the code of using `bpmapper` to realize model serialization in the previous chapter, the code using DRF is simpler and clearer, and DRF itself comes with a set of pages, which can facilitate us to view the data interface we customized using DRF, as shown in the following figure .

![](res/drf-app.png)

By directly using the page written in the previous section, you can render and display the subject data provided by the above interface through Vue.js, which will not be repeated here.

#### Implement teacher information data interface

Write a serializer.

````Python
class SubjectSimpleSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):

    class Meta:
        model = Subject
        fields = ('no', 'name')


class TeacherSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):

    class Meta:
        model = Teacher
        exclude = ('subject', )
````

Write the view function.

````Python
@api_view(('GET', ))
def show_teachers(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    try:
        sno = int(request.GET.get('sno'))
        subject = Subject.objects.only('name').get(no=sno)
        teachers = Teacher.objects.filter(subject=subject).defer('subject').order_by('no')
        subject_seri = SubjectSimpleSerializer(subject)
        teacher_seri = TeacherSerializer(teachers, many=True)
        return Response({'subject': subject_seri.data, 'teachers': teacher_seri.data})
    except (TypeError, ValueError, Subject.DoesNotExist):
        return Response(status=404)
````

Configure URL mapping.

````Python
urlpatterns = [
    
    path('api/teachers/', show_teachers),
    
]
````

Render the page via Vue.js.

````HTML

### User login with front-end and back-end separation

As we mentioned before, HTTP is stateless. After a request ends, the connection is disconnected. The next time the server receives a request, it does not know which user sent the request. But for a web application, it needs state management, so that the server can know which user the HTTP request comes from, so as to judge whether to allow the user's request and provide better service for the user, this process is often said* *Session management**.

The method we used to do session management (user tracking) before is: after the user logs in successfully, save the user-related data through a session object on the server side, and then write the ID of the session object into the browser's cookie; the next request, HTTP The request header carries the data of the cookie. The server reads the sessionid in the cookie from the HTTP request header, and finds the corresponding session object according to this identifier, so that the user data previously saved in the session can be obtained. As we just said, the REST architecture is the most suitable architecture for Internet applications. It emphasizes the statelessness of HTTP, so as to ensure the horizontal scalability of the application (when the number of concurrent visits increases, you can add new server nodes to help the system expansion). Obviously, the way to implement user tracking based on session requires the server to save the session object. When adding new server nodes for horizontal expansion, the session object needs to be copied and synchronized, which is obviously very troublesome. There are two solutions to this problem, one is to set up a cache server (such as Redis), let multiple server nodes share the cache service and place the session object directly in the cache server; the other way is to abandon session-based user tracking and use **Token-based user tracking**.

Token-based user tracking is to generate an identity for the user after the user logs in successfully and save it in the browser's local storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookie, etc.), so that the server does not need to save the user state, so it can be easily done Expand horizontally. The specific process of token-based user tracking is as follows:

1. When the user logs in, if the login is successful, a token is generated for the user in some way. The token usually contains information such as the user ID, expiration time, etc. and needs to be encrypted and generated fingerprints (to avoid forgery or tampering of the token). token), the server returns the token to the front end;
2. The front-end obtains the token returned by the server and saves it in the browser's local storage (it can be saved in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`, and for front-end projects using Vue.js, state management can also be performed through Vuex);
3. For projects that use front-end routing, each time the front-end routing jumps, you can first determine whether there is a token in `localStroage`, and if not, jump to the login page;
4. Each time the back-end data interface is requested, the token is carried in the HTTP request header; the back-end interface determines whether the request header has a token or not. If there is no token and the token is invalid or expired, the server returns 401 uniformly;
5. If the frontend receives HTTP response status code 401, redirect to the login page.

Through the above description, I believe you have found that the most important thing for token-based user tracking is to generate a token for the user as the user's identity when the user logs in successfully. There are many ways to generate tokens, one of the more mature solutions is to use JSON Web Token.

#### JWT overview

JSON Web Token, often abbreviated as JWT, is an open standard (RFC 7519). With the popularity of RESTful architecture, more and more projects use JWT as a way of user authentication. JWT is equivalent to three JSON objects that are encoded, separated by `.` and combined together. These three JSON objects are header, payload and signature, as shown in the following figure.

![](res/json-web-token.png)

1. Head

    ````JSON
    {
      "alg": "HS256",
      "typ": "JWT"
    }
    ````

    Among them, the `alg` attribute represents the signature algorithm, the default is HMAC SHA256 (abbreviated as `HS256`); the `typ` attribute represents the type of the token, which is uniformly written as `JWT` in JWT.

2. Load

    The payload part is used to store the data that actually needs to be transmitted. Seven optional fields are specified in the official JWT document:

    - iss : Issuer
    - exp: expiration time
    - sub: subject
    - aud: audience
    - nbf: effective time
    - iat: issue time
    - jti: number

    In addition to the officially defined dictionary, we can add custom fields according to the needs of the application, as shown below.

    ````JSON
    {
      "sub": "1234567890",
      "nickname": "jackfrued",
      "role": "admin"
    }
    ````

3. Signature

    The signature part is to generate a fingerprint for the first two parts to prevent data forgery and tampering. Implementing a signature first requires specifying a key. This key is only known to the server and cannot be disclosed to the user. Then, using the signature algorithm specified in the header (`HS256` by default), the signature is generated according to the following formula.

    ````Python
    HS256(base64Encode(header) + '.' + base64Encode(payload), secret)
    ````

    After the signature is calculated, the header, payload, and signature are spliced ​​into a string, and each part is separated by `.`, so that a JWT is generated.

#### Advantages and disadvantages of JWT

The advantages of using JWT are obvious, including:

1. It is easier to achieve horizontal scaling, because the token is stored in the browser, and the server does not need to do state management.
2. It is easier to prevent CSRF attacks, because adding the token in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` in the request header must be done by JavaScript code, not automatically added to the request header.
3. It can prevent forgery and tampering, because JWT has a signature, forged and tampered tokens cannot pass the signature verification, and will be regarded as invalid tokens.

Of course, any technology cannot have only advantages and no disadvantages. JWT also has many disadvantages. You need to pay attention when using it, including:

1. May be subject to XSS attack (cross-site scripting attack), obtain user token by injecting malicious script to execute JavaScript code.
2. Before the token expires, the issued token cannot be revoked. To solve this problem, additional intermediate layers and codes are needed to assist.
3. JWT is the user's identity token. Once leaked, anyone can get all the permissions of the user. In order to reduce the risk of the token being stolen, the validity period of the JWT should be set relatively short. For some more important permissions, the user should be authenticated again by other means, such as SMS verification code, etc.

#### Using PyJWT

In Python code, you can use the third-party library `PyJWT` to generate and verify JWT. Below is the command to install `PyJWT`.

````Bash
pip install pyjwt
````

Generate token.

````Python
payload = {
    'exp': datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(days=1),
    'userid': 10001
}
token = jwt.encode(payload, settings.SECRET_KEY).decode()
````

Authentication token.

````Python
try:
    token = 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1OTQ4NzIzOTEsInVzZXJpZCI6MTAwMDF9.FM-bNxemWLqQQBIsRVvc4gq71y42I9m2zt5nlFxNHUo'
    payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.SECRET_KEY)
except InvalidTokenError:
    raise AuthenticationFailed('Invalid token or token has expired')
````

If you don’t know the specific usage of JWT, you can take a look at the content of the 55th day, which provides the address of the complete voting project code.
