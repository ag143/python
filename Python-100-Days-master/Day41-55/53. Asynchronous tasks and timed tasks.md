## Asynchronous tasks and scheduled tasks

In a web application, if a request performs a time-consuming operation or the execution time of the request cannot be determined, and the user only needs to know that the server has received his request, he does not need to get the execution result of the request immediately. The operation should be processed asynchronously. If **using cache is the first point of optimizing website performance**, then asynchronizing tasks that consume time or execution time is uncertain is the second point of website performance optimization**, in short,** Don't do anything you can put off right away.

For example, sending text messages and uploading files to cloud storage mentioned in the previous chapter, the former is an operation with uncertain time (because as the caller, we cannot determine the response time of the third-party platform), and the latter is a time-consuming operation. Time operation (if the file is large or the third-party platform is unstable, it may lead to a long upload time). Obviously, these two operations can be processed asynchronously.

Asynchronous processing in Python projects can be done using multithreading or with the help of the third-party library Celery.
