## Middleware application

We had previously implemented the restriction that users had to be logged in to vote, but a new problem came. If there are many functions in our application that require users to log in before they can be executed, for example, the functions of exporting Excel reports and viewing statistical charts have been restricted to be accessed only by login, then do we need to add in each view function? code to check if session contains `userid` code? The answer is no, if we did, our view functions would inevitably be filled with a lot of repetitive code. Programming guru *Martin Fowler* once said: **Code has many bad smells, and repetition is the worst kind**. In Python programs, we can provide additional capabilities to functions through decorators; in Django projects, we can put repetitive code such as verifying whether the user is logged in into **middleware**.

### Django middleware overview

Middleware is a component inserted between the web application request and response process. It plays the role of an interception filter in the entire web application. The request and response can be intercepted and filtered through the middleware (simply put is to perform additional processing). Usually, a middleware component only focuses on completing one specific thing. For example, the Django framework implements session support through the `SessionMiddleware` middleware, and implements session-based request authentication through the `AuthenticationMiddleware` middleware. By combining multiple middlewares together, we can accomplish more complex tasks, which the Django framework does.

The configuration file of the Django project contains the configuration of the middleware, and the code is as follows.

````Python
MIDDLEWARE = ​​[
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
]
````

Let's explain a little bit about the role of these middleware:

1. `CommonMiddleware` - basic setup middleware that can handle some of the following configuration parameters.
   - DISALLOWED_USER_AGENTS - disallowed user agents (browser)
   - APPEND_SLASH - whether to append `/`
   - USE_ETAG - browser cache related
2. `SecurityMiddleware` - Security-related middleware, which can handle security-related configuration items.
   - SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS - time to force HTTPS
   - SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS - whether HTTPS covers subdomains
   - SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF - whether to allow the browser to infer the content type
   - SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER - whether to enable cross-site scripting attack filter
   - SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT - whether to redirect to HTTPS connections
   - SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT - exempts redirects to HTTPS
3. `SessionMiddleware` - Session Middleware.
4. `CsrfViewMiddleware` - Guards against forgery middleware across requests by generating tokens.
5. `XFrameOptionsMiddleware` - Middleware to prevent clickjacking attacks by setting request header parameters.

During the request process, the above middleware will be executed from top to bottom in the order of writing, followed by URL parsing, and finally the request will come to the view function; during the response process, the above middleware will be written in the order of writing. Executed from bottom to top, the reverse order of middleware execution at request time.

### Custom middleware

There are two ways to implement middleware in Django: class-based implementation and function-based implementation, the latter being closer to how decorators are written. The decorator is actually an application of the proxy mode, which places the cross-cutting concern functions (functions that are not necessarily related to normal business logic, such as: authentication, logging, encoding conversion and other functions) in the proxy, and the proxy object is used. Completes the behavior of the proxied object and adds extra functionality. Middleware intercepts and filters user requests and responses and adds additional processing. At this point, it is exactly the same as decorator, so the way to implement middleware based on function is almost exactly the same as that of decorator. Next, we use custom middleware to implement the function of user login verification.

````Python
"""
middlewares.py
"""
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.shortcuts import redirect

# Resource paths that require login to access
LOGIN_REQUIRED_URLS = {'/praise/', '/criticize/', '/excel/', '/teachers_data/'}


def check_login_middleware(get_resp):

    def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
        # The requested resource path is in the above collection
        if request.path in LOGIN_REQUIRED_URLS:
            # If the session contains userid, it is considered logged in
            if 'userid' not in request.session:
                # Determine if it is an Ajax request
                if request.is_ajax():
                    # Ajax request returns JSON data to prompt user to log in
                    return JsonResponse({'code': 10003, 'hint': 'Please log in first'})
                else:
                    backurl = request.get_full_path()
                    # Non-Ajax requests redirect directly to the login page
                    return redirect(f'/login/?backurl={backurl}')
        return get_resp(request, *args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper
````

Of course, we can also define a class to act as a decorator. If there is a `__call__` magic method in the class, the object of this class can be called like a function, so the following is another way to implement middleware, the reason is the same as above The code is exactly the same.

There is also a way to implement middleware based on classes. This way is deprecated in newer versions of Django, but it is still possible to encounter this way of writing in the code that you come into contact with. The approximate code is as follows .

````Python
from django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin


class MyMiddleware(MiddlewareMixin):

    def process_request(self, request):
        pass

    def process_view(self, request, view_func, view_args, view_kwargs):
        pass

    def process_template_response(self, request, response):
        pass

    def process_response(self, request, response):
        pass

    def process_exception(self, request, exception):
        pass
````

The five methods in the above class are all hook functions of the middleware, which are called back when the user request is received, before entering the view function, when the template is rendered, when the response is returned, and when an exception occurs. Of course, whether to write these methods is determined according to the needs of middleware. Not all scenarios need to rewrite the five methods. The following figure is believed to help you understand this writing method.

![](res/django-middleware.png)

After writing the middleware code, you need to modify the configuration file to activate the middleware and make it take effect.

````Python
MIDDLEWARE = ​​[
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',
    'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware',
    'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
    'vote.middlewares.check_login_middleware',
]
````

Pay attention to the order of the elements in the middleware list above. When a request from the user is received, the middleware is executed in order from top to bottom. After the middleware is completed, the request will finally reach the view function. Of course, in this process, the user's request can be intercepted, just like our custom middleware above, if the user accesses the protected resource without logging in, the middleware will redirect the request directly to the login page, the following middleware and view functions will no longer be executed. In the process of responding to the user request, the above middleware will be executed in order from bottom to top, so that we can further process the response.

The order in which middleware is executed is very important. For middleware with dependencies, it must be ensured that the dependent middleware should be placed in front of the middleware that depends on it, just like the middleware we just customized should be placed in `SessionMiddleware` The latter, because we have to rely on the `session` object bound to the request by this middleware to determine whether the user is logged in.
