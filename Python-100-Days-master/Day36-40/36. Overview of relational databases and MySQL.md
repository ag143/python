## Overview of relational databases and MySQL

### Relational Database Overview

1. Data persistence - save the data to a storage medium that can save the data for a long time, and the data will not be lost in the event of a power failure.

2. History of database development - mesh database, hierarchical database, relational database, NoSQL database, NewSQL database.

   > In 1970, IBM researcher E.F. Codd published a paper called *A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks* on *Communication of the ACM*, proposing the concept of **relational model** and establishing relationships The theoretical basis of the model. Later, Codd published a number of articles one after another, discussing the paradigm theory and 12 criteria for measuring relational systems, laying the foundation for relational databases with mathematical theory.

3. Features of relational database.

   - Theoretical foundation: **Relational Algebra** (relational operations, set theory, first-order predicate logic).

   - Concrete representation: organize data in **two-dimensional table** (with rows and columns).

   - Programming language: **Structured Query Language** (SQL).

4. ER model (entity relationship model) and conceptual model diagram.

   **ER model**, the full name of **Entity-Relationship Model** (Entity-Relationship Model), was proposed by Mr. Chen Pinshan, a Chinese-American computer scientist, and is a high-level description of the conceptual data model, as shown in the figure below.

   - Solid - Rectangle
   - Properties - Oval Box
   - Relationships - Diamond Box
   - Multiplicity - 1:1 (one-to-one) / 1:N (one-to-many) / M:N (many-to-many)

   In actual project development, we can use database modeling tools (such as: PowerDesigner) to draw the conceptual data model (the essence of which is the ER model), and then set the target database system, convert the conceptual model into a physical model, and finally generate and create a second model. SQL for dimension tables (many tools can export SQL or directly generate data tables based on the physical model diagram we designed and the target database set).

5. Relational database products.
   - [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) - Currently the most widely used database management system in the world, as a general database system, it has complete data management functions; as a relational database , it is a complete relational product; as a distributed database, it realizes the function of distributed processing. In Oracle's latest 12c release, a multi-tenant architecture has also been introduced, with which database clouds can be easily deployed and managed.
   - [DB2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/db2/) - Developed by IBM, mainly running on Unix (including IBM's own [AIX](https://zh.wikipedia .org/wiki/AIX)), Linux, and Windows Server Edition, and other relational database products. DB2 has a long history and is considered to be the first database product to use SQL, and it has relatively powerful business intelligence capabilities.
   - [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/) - A relational database product developed and promoted by Microsoft, originally suitable for data management of small and medium enterprises, but in recent years it The scope of its application has expanded, and some large enterprises and even multinational companies have begun to build their own data management systems based on it.
   - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - MySQL is open source, anyone can download it under the license of GPL (General Public License) and modify it according to individual needs. MySQL is in the spotlight for its speed, reliability, and adaptability.
   - [PostgreSQL]() - An open source relational database product released under the BSD license.

### Introduction to MySQL

MySQL was originally an open source relational database management system developed by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008. In 2009, Oracle Corporation (Oracle) acquired Sun Microsystems, so MySQL is now also a product of Oracle.

MySQL has become the most popular open source database in the past due to its high performance, low cost and good reliability, so it has been widely used in small and medium website development. As MySQL continues to mature, it is gradually applied to more large-scale websites and applications, such as Wikipedia, Google, Facebook, Taobao and other websites all use MySQL to provide data persistence services .

After Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems, the price of MySQL's commercial version has been greatly increased, and Oracle no longer supports another free software project [OpenSolaris](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris) development, leading to concerns in the free software community about whether Oracle will continue to support the MySQL Community Edition (the only free version of MySQL's various distributions). fork of [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB) (the database named after his daughter). There are many companies that used MySQL database (for example: Wikipedia) have completed the migration from MySQL database to MariaDB database.

#### Linux environment

The following takes the CentOS 7.x environment as an example to demonstrate how to install MySQL 5.7.x. If you need to install other versions of MySQL under other Linux systems, please find the corresponding installation tutorial on the Internet.

1. Install MySQL.

   The installation file can be downloaded from the [MySQL official website](<https://www.mysql.com/>). First, select the platform and version on the download page, and then find the corresponding download link, directly download the archive file containing all the installation files, and install it through the package management tool after unarchiving.

   ```Shell
   wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.7/mysql-5.7.26-1.el7.x86_64.rpm-bundle.tar
   tar -xvf mysql-5.7.26-1.el7.x86_64.rpm-bundle.tar
   ````

   If there are MariaDB related files on the system, you need to remove the MariaDB related files first.

   ```Shell
   yum list installed | grep mariadb | awk '{print $1}' | xargs yum erase -y
   ````

   Update and install underlying dependencies that may be used.

   ````Bash
   yum update
   yum install -y libaio libaio-devel
   ````

   Next you can install MySQL using the RPM (Redhat Package Manager) tool in the order shown below.

   ```Shell
   rpm -ivh mysql-community-common-5.7.26-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
   rpm -ivh mysql-community-libs-5.7.26-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
   rpm -ivh mysql-community-libs-compat-5.7.26-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
   rpm -ivh mysql-community-devel-5.7.26-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
   rpm -ivh mysql-community-client-5.7.26-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
   rpm -ivh mysql-community-server-5.7.26-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
   ````

   You can use the following command to view the installed MySQL related packages.

   ```Shell
   rpm -qa | grep mysql
   ````

2. Configure MySQL.

   The MySQL configuration file is in the `/etc` directory, named `my.cnf`. The default configuration file content is as follows.

   ```Shell
   cat /etc/my.cnf
   ````

   ````INI
   # For advice on how to change settings please see
   # http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-configuration-defaults.html
   
   [mysqld]
   #
   # Remove leading # and set to the amount of RAM for the most important data
   # cache in MySQL. Start at 70% of total RAM for dedicated server, else 10%.
   # innodb_buffer_pool_size = 128M
   #
   # Remove leading # to turn on a very important data integrity option: logging
   # changes to the binary log between backups.
   # log_bin
   #
   # Remove leading # to set options mainly useful for reporting servers.
   # The server defaults are faster for transactions and fast SELECTs.
   # Adjust sizes as needed, experiment to find the optimal values.
   # join_buffer_size = 128M
   # sort_buffer_size = 2M
   # read_rnd_buffer_size = 2M
   datadir=/var/lib/mysql
   socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
   
   # Disabling symbolic-links is recommended to prevent assorted security risks
   symbolic-links=0
   
   log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log
   pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid
   ````

   Through the configuration file, we can modify the port, character set, maximum number of connections, socket queue size, maximum packet size, log file location, log expiration time and other configurations used by the MySQL service. Of course, we can also perform performance tuning and security control on the MySQL server by modifying the configuration file.

3. Start the MySQL service.

   MySQL can be started using the following command.

   ```Shell
   service mysqld start
   ````

   In CentOS 7, it is more recommended to use the following command to start MySQL.

   ```Shell
   systemctl start mysqld
   ````

   After starting MySQL successfully, you can use the following command to check the network port usage. MySQL uses the `3306` port by default.

   ```Shell
   netstat -ntlp | grep mysql
   ````

   You can also use the following command to find out if there is a process named `mysqld`.

   ```Shell
   pgrep mysqld
   ````

4. Use the MySQL client tool to connect to the server.

   Command Line Tools:

   ```Shell
   mysql -u root -p
   ````

   > Description: When starting the client, the `-u` parameter is used to specify the user name. The default super management account of MySQL is `root`; `-p` means to enter a password (user password); Non-local, you can use `-h` to specify the hostname or IP address of the connecting host.

   If you are installing MySQL for the first time, you can use the following command to find the default initial password.

   ```Shell
   cat /var/log/mysqld.log | grep password
   ````

   The above command will check the MySQL log with `password` line, in the displayed result, the part after `root@localhost:` is the default initial password.

   After entering the client tool, you can use the following command to modify the access password of the super administrator (root) to `123456`.

   ````SQL
   set global validate_password_policy=0;
   set global validate_password_length=6;
   alter user 'root'@'localhost' identified by '123456';
   ````

   > **Note**: The newer version of MySQL does not allow the use of weak passwords as user passwords by default, so the above code modifies the policy and password length for verifying user passwords. In fact we should not use weak passwords because there is a risk of brute force cracking of user passwords. In recent years, incidents of **attacking the database to steal data and hijacking the database to extort bitcoin** are not uncommon. To avoid these potential risks, the most important point is **not to expose the database server to the public network** (the best practice It is to place the database on the intranet, at least not open the access port of the database server to the public network), and keep the password of the `root` account. When the application system needs to access the database, the `root` account is usually not used. access, but **create another account with appropriate permissions to access**.

   When you connect to the MySQL server again using the client tool, you can use the newly set password. In actual development, in order to facilitate user operations, you can choose a graphical client tool to connect to the MySQL server, including:

   - MySQL Workbench (official tool)

#### macOS environment

It is relatively simple to install MySQL on the macOS system. You only need to download the DMG installation file from the official website just mentioned and run it. When downloading, you need to select the download link according to whether you are using an Intel chip or an Apple M1 chip, as follows as shown in the figure.

<img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211121215901.png" style="zoom:50%;">

After the installation is successful, you can find "MySQL" in "System Preferences". In the screen shown below, you can start and stop the MySQL server, and you can also configure the path of the MySQL core file.
