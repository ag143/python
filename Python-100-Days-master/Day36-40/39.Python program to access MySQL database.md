## Python program access to MySQL database

In Python3, we can use the `mysqlclient` or `pymysql` tripartite library to access the MySQL database and implement data persistence operations. The usage of the two is exactly the same, but the imported module name is different. We recommend that you use the pure Python third-party library `pymysql`, because it is easier to install successfully. Below, we still take the previously created database named `hrs` as an example to demonstrate how to operate the MySQL database through Python programs to achieve data persistence operations.

### Build database and table

````SQL
-- Create a database named hrs and specify the default character set
create database `hrs` default character set utf8mb4;

-- switch to hrs database
use `hrs`;

-- create department table
create table `tb_dept`
(
`dno` int not null comment 'Number',
`dname` varchar(10) not null comment 'name',
`dloc` varchar(20) not null comment 'Location',
primary key (`dno`)
);

-- insert 4 departments
insert into `tb_dept` values
    (10, 'Accounting Department', 'Beijing'),
    (20, 'R&D Department', 'Chengdu'),
    (30, 'Sales Department', 'Chongqing'),
    (40, 'Operation and Maintenance Department', 'Shenzhen');

-- create employee table
create table `tb_emp`
(
`eno` int not null comment 'employee number',
`ename` varchar(20) not null comment 'employee name',
`job` varchar(20) not null comment 'employee position',
`mgr` int comment 'Supervisor number',
`sal` int not null comment 'Employee monthly salary',
`comm` int comment 'Monthly allowance',
`dno` int not null comment 'Department number',
primary key (`eno`),
constraint `fk_emp_mgr` foreign key (`mgr`) references tb_emp (`eno`),
constraint `fk_emp_dno` foreign key (`dno`) references tb_dept (`dno`)
);

-- Insert 14 employees
insert into `tb_emp` values
    (7800, 'Zhang Sanfeng', 'President', null, 9000, 1200, 20),
    (2056, 'Qiao Feng', 'Analyst', 7800, 5000, 1500, 20),
    (3088, 'Li Mochou', 'Designer', 2056, 3500, 800, 20),
    (3211, 'Zhang Wuji', 'Programmer', 2056, 3200, null, 20),
    (3233, 'Qiu Chuji', 'programmer', 2056, 3400, null, 20),
    (3251, 'Zhang Cuishan', 'programmer', 2056, 4000, null, 20),
    (5566, 'Song Yuanqiao', 'Accountant', 7800, 4000, 1000, 10),
    (5234, 'Guo Jing', 'Cashier', 5566, 2000, null, 10),
    (3344, 'Huang Rong', 'Sales Supervisor', 7800, 3000, 800, 30),
    (1359, 'Hu Yidao', 'Salesman', 3344, 1800, 200, 30),
    (4466, 'Miao Renfeng', 'Salesman', 3344, 2500, null, 30),
    (3244, 'Ouyang Feng', 'Programmer', 3088, 3200, null, 20),
    (3577, 'Yang Guo', 'Accounting', 5566, 2200, null, 10),
    (3588, 'Zhu Jiuzhen', 'Accounting', 5566, 2500, null, 10);

### Access MySQL

First, we can install `pymysql` on the command line or in the terminal of PyCharm with the following command. If you need to access MySQL 8, you also need to install a third-party library called `cryptography` to support the password authentication method of MySQL 8.

```Shell
pip install pymysql cryptography
````

The steps to operate MySQL using `pymysql` are as follows:

1. Create a connection. After the MySQL server is started, it provides network services based on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). We can connect to the MySQL server through the `connect` function of the `pymysql` module. When calling the `connect` function, you need to specify the host (`host`), port (`port`), username (`user`), password (`password`), database (`database`), character set (` charset`) and other parameters, the function will return a `Connection` object.
2. Get the cursor. After the connection to the MySQL server is successful, the next thing to do is to send an SQL statement to the database server, and MySQL will execute the received SQL and return the execution result through the network. To achieve this operation, you need to first obtain the cursor (`Cursor`) object through the `cursor` method of the connection object.
3. Issue SQL. Through the `execute` method of the cursor object, we can issue SQL statements to the database.
4. If you perform an `insert`, `delete` or `update` operation, you need to commit or roll back the transaction according to the actual situation. Because the transaction environment is enabled by default when the connection is created, after the operation is completed, the `commit` or `rollback` method of the connection object needs to be used to commit or roll back the transaction. The `rollback` method is usually placed in the exception catch code block in `except`. If you execute the `select` operation, you need to fetch the results of the query through the cursor object. There are three corresponding methods: `fetchone`, `fetchmany` and `fetchall`. The `fetchone` method will fetch a record and return it as a tuple or dictionary; the `fetchmany` and `fetchall` methods will fetch multiple records and return it as a nested tuple or a list loaded dictionary .
5. Close the connection. Don't forget to close the connection to free external resources after the persistence operation is complete. We usually close the connection using the `close` method of the connection object in the `finally` block.

### Code practice

Below, we demonstrate the five steps mentioned above through code practice.

#### insert data

````Python
import pymysql

no = int(input('Department number: '))
name = input('Department name: ')
location = input('Department location: ')

# 1. Create a connection (Connection)
conn = pymysql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=3306,
                       user='guest', password='Guest.618',
                       database='hrs', charset='utf8mb4')
try:
    # 2. Get the cursor object (Cursor)
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # 3. Issue an SQL statement to the database server through the cursor object
        affected_rows = cursor.execute(
            'insert into `tb_dept` values ​​(%s, %s, %s)',
            (no, name, location)
        )
        if affected_rows == 1:
            print('Added department successfully!!!')
    # 4. Commit the transaction
    conn.commit()
except pymysql.MySQLError as err:
    # 4. Rollback the transaction
    conn.rollback()
    print(type(err), err)
finally:
    # 5. Close the connection to release resources
    conn.close()
````

> **Description**: The `127.0.0.1` above is called the loopback address, which represents the local machine. The following `guest` is a user I created in advance, this user has `insert`, `delete`, `update` and `select` permissions to the `hrs` database. We do not recommend that you use the `root` super administrator account to access the database directly in the project, it is too dangerous to do so. We can create and authorize a user named `guest` using the command below.
>
> ````SQL
> create user 'guest'@'%' identified by 'Guest.618';
> grant insert, delete, update, select on `hrs`.* to 'guest'@'%';
> ````

If you want to insert a large amount of data, it is recommended to use the `executemany` method of the cursor object to do batch processing (an `insert` operation is followed by multiple sets of data), you can try to insert 10,000 records into a table, and then see if the batch is not used. What's the difference between handling bar-by-bar inserts and using batch processing. The first parameter of the `executemany` method of the cursor object is still the SQL statement, and the second parameter can be a list or tuple containing multiple sets of data.

#### delete data

````Python
import pymysql

no = int(input('Department number: '))

# 1. Create a connection (Connection)
conn = pymysql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=3306,
                       user='guest', password='Guest.618',
                       database='hrs', charset='utf8mb4',
                       autocommit=True)
try:
    # 2. Get the cursor object (Cursor)
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # 3. Issue an SQL statement to the database server through the cursor object
        affected_rows = cursor.execute(
            'delete from `tb_dept` where `dno`=%s',
            (no, )
        )
        if affected_rows == 1:
            print('Delete department successfully!!!')
finally:
    # 5. Close the connection to release resources
    conn.close()
````

> **Note**: If you do not want to manually commit or roll back the transaction after each SQL operation, you can add a parameter named `autocommit` to the `connect` function and set its value to `True`, indicating that every time Automatically commit after successful SQL execution. However, we recommend that you commit or roll back manually, so that the transaction environment can be constructed according to actual business needs. If you don't want to catch the exception and handle it, you can directly follow the `finally` block after the `try` block. Omitting `except` means that when an exception occurs, the code will crash directly and the exception stack will be displayed in the terminal.

#### update data

````Python
import pymysql

no = int(input('Department number: '))
name = input('Department name: ')
location = input('Department location: ')

# 1. Create a connection (Connection)
conn = pymysql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=3306,
                       user='guest', password='Guest.618',
                       database='hrs', charset='utf8mb4')
try:
    # 2. Get the cursor object (Cursor)
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # 3. Issue an SQL statement to the database server through the cursor object
        affected_rows = cursor.execute(
            'update `tb_dept` set `dname`=%s, `dloc`=%s where `dno`=%s',
            (name, location, no)
        )
        if affected_rows == 1:
            print('Update department information successfully!!!')
    # 4. Commit the transaction
    conn.commit()
except pymysql.MySQLError as err:
    # 4. Rollback the transaction
    conn.rollback()
    print(type(err), err)
finally:
    # 5. Close the connection to release resources
    conn.close()
````

#### Query data

1. Query the data of the department table.

````Python
import pymysql

# 1. Create a connection (Connection)
conn = pymysql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=3306,
                       user='guest', password='Guest.618',
                       database='hrs', charset='utf8mb4')
try:
    # 2. Get the cursor object (Cursor)
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # 3. Issue an SQL statement to the database server through the cursor object
        cursor.execute('select `dno`, `dname`, `dloc` from `tb_dept`')
        # 4. Fetch data through cursor object
        row = cursor.fetchone()
        while row:
            print(row)
            row = cursor.fetchone()
except pymysql.MySQLError as err:
    print(type(err), err)
finally:
    # 5. Close the connection to release resources
    conn.close()
````
>**Description**: In the above code, we implement the operation of fetching the query results row by row by constructing a `while` loop. This method is especially suitable for scenarios where the query result has many rows. Because if you use `fetchall` to fetch all records into a nested tuple at once, it will cause a very large memory overhead, which is not a good idea in many scenarios. If you are unwilling to use the `while` loop, you can also consider using the `iter` function to construct an iterator to fetch data line by line. Interested readers can study by themselves.

2. Query the data of the employee table by paging.

````Python
import pymysql

page = int(input('page number: '))
size = int(input('size: '))

# 1. Create a connection (Connection)
con = pymysql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=3306,
                      user='guest', password='Guest.618',
                      database='hrs', charset='utf8')
try:
    # 2. Get the cursor object (Cursor)
    with con.cursor(pymysql.cursors.DictCursor) as cursor:
        # 3. Issue an SQL statement to the database server through the cursor object
        cursor.execute(
            'select `eno`, `ename`, `job`, `sal` from `tb_emp` order by `sal` desc limit %s,%s',
            ((page - 1) * size, size)
        )
        # 4. Fetch data through cursor object
        for emp_dict in cursor.fetchall():
            print(emp_dict)
finally:
    # 5. Close the connection to release resources
    con.close()
````

### Case study

Below we will explain an example of exporting database table data to an Excel file. We need to install the `openpyxl` tripartite library first. The command is as follows.

````Bash
pip install openpyxl
````

Next, we export the number, name, position, monthly salary, allowance and department name of all employees in the database `hrs` to an Excel file through the following code.

````Python
import openpyxl
import pymysql

# create workbook object
workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()
# get the default worksheet
sheet = workbook.active
# Modify the title of the worksheet
sheet.title = 'Employee basic information'
# add header to worksheet
sheet.append(('job number', 'name', 'position', 'monthly salary', 'subsidy', 'department'))
# Create a connection (Connection)
conn = pymysql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=3306,
                       user='guest', password='Guest.618',
                       database='hrs', charset='utf8mb4')
try:
    # Get the cursor object (Cursor)
    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # Execute SQL statement through cursor object
        cursor.execute(
            'select `eno`, `ename`, `job`, `sal`, coalesce(`comm`, 0), `dname` '
            'from `tb_emp` natural join `tb_dept`'
        )
        # Fetch data via cursor
        row = cursor.fetchone()
        while row:
            # Write the data row by row to the worksheet
            sheet.append(row)
            row = cursor.fetchone()
    # save the workbook
    workbook.save('hrs.xlsx')
except pymysql.MySQLError as err:
    print(err)
finally:
    # close the connection to release resources
    conn.close()
````

You can refer to the above example and try to import the data of the Excel file into the specified table of the specified database to see if it can be successful.
