## Know the question answer

### After learning the basic grammar knowledge in Python, how to improve it further?

If you have finished learning the basic syntax of Python and want to know how to improve next, then you have to ask yourself what are you going to use Python for? At present, the possible employment directions after learning Python include the following fields. I have used the technologies required in each field as a simple keyword summary.

Of course, to learn programming, the most important thing is to improve your comprehensive ability through actual project combat. There are a large number of high-quality open source projects on Github, including many high-quality Python projects. There is a project named ["awesome-python-applications"](https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications) that categorizes these high-quality resources and provides portals, you can understand Down. If the self-learning ability is not so strong, you can learn the corresponding knowledge through free or paid video courses on the Internet; if the self-discipline is not so strong, you can only recommend spending money to attend training courses, because the money is spent in a supervised environment Learning is indeed a shortcut for many people, but remember: "The master leads the door, and the practice depends on everyone." Choose what you love and do your best, don't blindly follow the trend to learn, this is the advice of people who have come here. I remember when I first entered the software development industry, someone told me this sentence, and now I share it with you: "There are two kinds of impetuous people: those who only wait and see but do not study, those who only study but do not study. Persistent people; impetuous people are not masters."
