## Zen of Python

1. Beautiful is better than ugly. <br>
2. Explicit is better than implicit. <br>
3. Simple is better than complex. <br>
4. Complex is better than complicated.<br>
5. Flat is better than nested. <br>
6. Sparse is better than dense. (Sparse is better than dense) <br>
7. Readability counts. (Readability is important)<br>
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. <br>
9. Although practicality beats purity. (But reality is often not so perfect)<br>
10. Errors should never pass silently. <br>
11. Unless explicitly silenced. (unless you wish) <br>
12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15. Now is better than never.<br>
16. Although never is often better than \*right\* now.
17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. <br>
18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. (If an implementation is easy to understand, it is likely to be a good idea)<br>
19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
