##Python - 100 days from novice to master


>
> **Description**: From the launch of the project to the time it got 8w+ stars, I have always received feedback that the basic part (the content of the first 15 days) is difficult for beginners, and it is recommended to have a supporting video to explain it. The content of the basic part was recently remade into a project called ["Python-Core-50-Courses"](<https://github.com/jackfrued/Python-Core-50-Courses>), **with This part of the content has been rewritten in a more simple and popular way with a video explanation**, and beginners can pay attention to this new project. If you need **Python basic video**, you can search for ["Quick Start with Python Zero Basics"] (https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FT4y1R7sz) on "Station B", this set of videos is when I lecture The recorded video quality is acceptable and the sound quality is average, but it should be helpful for beginners. You are welcome to leave a message, comment, and post a bullet screen. After learning, friends who feel that they have gained something can "one-click three connections" to support the UP master (Qianfeng Python). If domestic users are slow to access GitHub, they can follow my **zhihu account [Python-Jack](https://www.zhihu.com/people/jackfrued)**, the above ["Learn Python from scratch] ”](<https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/c_1216656665569013760>) The column is more suitable for beginners, and other columns are also being continuously created and updated. You are welcome to pay attention and like and comment.

>
> Creation is not easy, thank you for your support, these money will not be used for personal consumption (for example: buying coffee), but will be donated to those in need through platforms such as Tencent Public Welfare, Meituan Public Welfare, Shuidichou ([Click]( ./changelog.md) for donations). If you need to join the QQ learning group, you can scan the QR code below, add one to the three groups, and do not enter the group repeatedly. The learning group will provide you with **learning resources** and **question answers**. If there are **Python experience classes** and **industry open classes**, you will be notified in advance in the group, and you are welcome to join.
>
> The "Day80~90" part of the project is still under creation, because the author usually can't squeeze too much time to write the document, so the update speed is relatively slow, thank you for your understanding。

1. Software Process Model
   - Classical Process Model (Waterfall Model)
     - Feasibility analysis (do or not do research), output "Feasibility Analysis Report".
     - Requirement analysis (research what to do), output "Requirements Specification" and product interface prototype diagram.
     - Outline design and detailed design, output conceptual model diagram (ER diagram), physical model diagram, class diagram, sequence diagram, etc.
     - Coding/Testing.
     - Go live/maintenance.

     The biggest disadvantage of the waterfall model is that it cannot embrace changes in requirements. The product can only be seen after the entire process is completed, and team morale is low.
   - Agile Development (Scrum) - Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer - Sprint
     - Backlog of the product (user stories, product prototypes).
     - Planning meeting (assessment and budget).
     - Daily development (standup meetings, Pomodoro Technique, pair programming, test first, code refactoring...).
     - Bug fixes (problem description, steps to reproduce, testers, assignees).
     - release version.
     - Review meeting (Showcase, users need to participate).
     - Retrospective meeting (a summary of the current iteration cycle).

> Supplement: Manifesto on Agile Software Development
     >
     > - **Individuals and Interactions** over Processes and Tools
     > - **working software** above well documented
     > - **Customer cooperation** over contract negotiation
     > - **responding to changes** higher than following a plan

     ![](./res/agile-scrum-sprint-cycle.png)

     > Roles: product owner (who decides what to do, who can decide what needs to be done), team leader (solving various problems, focusing on how to work better, shielding external influences on the development team), development team (project executives) , specifically developers and testers).

     > Preparations: business case and funding, contracts, vision, initial product requirements, initial release plans, stakes, team building.

     > Agile teams are typically 8-10 people.

     > Workload estimation: Quantify the development tasks, including prototype, logo design, UI design, front-end development, etc., try to decompose each work into the minimum task volume. The minimum task volume standard is that the working time should not exceed two days, and then estimate the overall project time. Post each task on the board, which is divided into three parts: to do (to be completed), in progress (in progress) and done (completed).
2. Project team formation

   - Team composition and roles

     > Description: Thank you, Ms. Fu Xiangying, for helping me draw the following beautiful company organizational chart.

     ![](./res/pylint.png)

   - Some "conventions" in Python (please refer to ["Python Conventions - How to Write Pythonic Code"](Python Conventions.md))

   - Reasons affecting code readability:

     - Too few or no code comments
     - Code breaks language best practices
     - Anti-pattern programming (spaghetti code, copy-paste programming, conceited programming, …)

3. Introduction to team development tools
   - Version Control: Git, Mercury
   - Defect management: [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org.cn/)

   - Continuous Integration: [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)

   Please refer to ["Problems and Solutions for Team Project Development"](Day91-100/91. Problems and Solutions for Team Project Development.md).

##### Project topic selection and business understanding

1. Topic selection range setting

   - CMS (Client): News aggregation website, Q&A/sharing community, movie review/book review website, etc.
   - MIS (user terminal + management terminal): KMS, KPI assessment system, HRS, CRM system, supply chain system, warehouse management system, etc.

   - App background (management terminal + data interface): second-hand transactions, newspapers and magazines, niche e-commerce, news, tourism, social networking, reading, etc.
   - Other types: own industry background and work experience, business is easy to understand and control.

2. Requirements understanding, module division and task assignment

   - Requirements Understanding: Brainstorming and Competitive Analysis.
   - Module division: draw a mind map (XMind), each module is a branch node, and each specific function is a leaf node (expressed by a verb), it is necessary to ensure that each leaf node cannot reproduce new nodes, and determine each The importance, priority and workload of leaf nodes.
   - Task Assignment: Assign tasks to each team member by the project leader based on the metrics above.

   ![](./res/requirements_by_xmind.png)

2. Cache configuration (partition cache, key settings, timeout settings, master-slave replication, failure recovery (sentry))
3. Log configuration
4. Analysis and debugging (Django-Debug-ToolBar)
5. Easy-to-use Python modules (date calculation, image processing, data encryption, third-party API)

##### REST API Design

1. RESTful architecture

   - [YAPI](http://yapi.demo.qunar.com/)
3. Application of [django-REST-framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

##### Analysis of the key and difficult points in the project

1. Use cache to relieve database pressure - Redis
2. Use message queues for decoupling and peak clipping - Celery + RabbitMQ
#### Day 96: [Software Testing and Automation Testing](Day91-100/96.Software Testing and Automation Testing.md)

##### unit test

1. Types of tests
2. Writing unit tests (`unittest`, `pytest`, `nose2`, `tox`, `ddt`, …)
3. Test coverage (`coverage`)

##### Django project deployment

1. Preparations before deployment
   - key settings (SECRET_KEY / DEBUG / ALLOWED_HOSTS / cache / database)
   - HTTPS/CSRF_COOKIE_SECUR/SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE
   - Log related configuration
2. Review of common Linux commands
3. Installation and configuration of Linux common services
4. Use of uWSGI/Gunicorn and Nginx
   - Comparison of Gunicorn and uWSGI
     - For simple applications that don't require a lot of customization, Gunicorn is a good choice, uWSGI has a much steeper learning curve than Gunicorn, and Gunicorn's default parameters are already suitable for most applications.
     - uWSGI supports heterogeneous deployment.
     - Since Nginx itself supports uWSGI, Nginx and uWSGI are usually bundled and deployed online, and uWSGI is a fully functional and highly customized WSGI middleware.
     - In terms of performance, Gunicorn and uWSGI are actually equivalent.
5. Use virtualization technology (Docker) to deploy test environment and production environment

##### Performance Testing

1. Use of AB
2. Use of SQLslap
3. Use of sysbench

##### automated test

1. Automated Testing with Shell and Python
2. Use Selenium to implement automated testing
   -Selenium IDE
   -Selenium WebDriver
   -Selenium Remote Control
3. Test tool Robot Framework introduction
