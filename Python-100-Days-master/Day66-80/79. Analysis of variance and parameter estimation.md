## ANOVA and parameter estimation

### variance analysis

#### basic concept

In product operation, we will encounter various scenarios where we need to evaluate the operational effect, including whether the promotion activities are effective, whether the A/B testing strategy is effective, etc. For example, the average DAU before the product upgrade is 1.55 million, and the average DAU after the product upgrade is 1.57 million. So how to judge whether the increase of 20,000 DAU is a normal fluctuation or the effect of the upgrade? Comparing the data changes of the same set of data before and after implementing certain strategies to determine whether the data fluctuations are caused by a certain factor, this method is called variance analysis. Analysis of variance is usually abbreviated as ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), also known as "F test", which is used to test the difference of two or more grouped samples. Simply put, the method to analyze whether the significance of the difference is obvious is the analysis of variance.

As an example, if we need to analyze whether the amount of coupons can play an effective role in the user's purchase conversion rate, we can divide the data into the following three groups:

The purchase behavior of users is random. There are not many people with a high purchase rate, and there are not many people with a very low purchase rate. The purchase rate of most users is concentrated around a certain value, which we call the overall purchase rate. average value. If the average purchase rate of each customer group is inconsistent with the overall average purchase rate, the following two situations will occur.

1. The first case

    The average purchase rate of the blue group (blue line) is higher than the overall average (black line). It may be that the high purchase rate on the far right has raised the average of the group, and the data distribution of the blue group is very high. Scattered (large variance), at this time, it cannot be fully assured that the purchase conversion rate of this group of users is very high.

2. The second case

    The average purchase rate of the green group (green line) is higher than the overall average (black line), but the data of the green group is very concentrated, all concentrated near the group average (green line), at this time we can consider this group The average conversion rate of .

In order to better express the above problem, we can introduce the concept of "within-group variance", that is, to describe the discrete situation of the data distribution within each group. As shown in the figure below, for the "within-group variance" of the blue and green groupings above, it is clear that the within-group variance of blue is larger, and the within-group variance of green is smaller.

To sum up, if the average purchase rate of users in the above three groups is not around the middle line (overall purchase rate), but is obviously high or low, and each conversion rate in this group is closely around the near the mean of the group's purchase rate (ie, the within-group variance is small). Then we can conclude that the purchase rate of this group is inconsistent with the whole, which is caused by the influence of the corresponding discount amount of this group.

#### Quantitative Analysis

For quantitative analysis, you can use the F-test value and the F crit threshold. The F test value is used to accurately express the difference between these groups, and the F crit critical value is a judgment baseline:

- When F > F crit, the difference between these groups exceeds the judgment benchmark, and it is considered that the purchase rate between groups with different discount amounts is different, and the discount amount will affect the purchase rate, that is to say, through the operation The starting point of the discount amount is to increase the user's purchase conversion rate;
- When F < F crit, it is considered that the purchase rate between groups with different discount amounts is the same, and the discount amount will not affect the purchase rate.

> **Note**: In the figure, SS represents variance, df represents index degrees of freedom, MS represents mean square error, and P-value represents the significance level of the difference.

The above figure shows the variance analysis results of groups A, B, and C obtained by Excel. As shown in the figure, F < F crit, so from the perspective of quantitative analysis, it can be determined that the discount amount will not affect the purchase rate.

#### Method of implementation

The implementation of ANOVA can be divided into the following three steps:

1. Determine whether the sample meets the preconditions of "ANOVA"

    - each value in each grouping must be from the same population sample;
    - ANOVA can only analyze indicators that satisfy a normal distribution. In fact, most indicators in product operations are normally distributed, such as:
        - Almost all conversion rates satisfy a normal distribution: purchase rate, click-through rate, conversion rate, activity rate, retention rate, repurchase rate, etc.
        - Almost all business volumes satisfy the normal distribution: customer unit price, number of new users per day, traffic flow through channels, etc.
        - Almost all user profile indicators satisfy the normal distribution: age, city, number of logins, duration of use, etc.
    - The sample analyzed must be a random sample

2. Calculate the F-test value and the F crit value

3. If there is a difference, the size of the difference needs to be assessed

    We use a new metric to express: $R^2=SSA/SST$, where $R^2$ is the difference size, $SSA$ is the between-group error sum of squares, and $SST$ is the total squared error sum.

    - When $ R^2 \gt 0.5 $, the difference between each group is considered to be very significant;
    - When $ R^2 $ is between $ [0.1, 0.5] $, it is considered that the difference between each group is generally significant;
    - When $ R^2 \lt 0.1 $, the difference between groups is considered to be weak and significant.

#### Multivariate ANOVA

The above case is for a strategy to analyze the effect. We call this form of ANOVA one-way ANOVA. In practice, we may need to study the impact of multiple strategies (such as channels, activities, customer groups, etc.) on the results, which we call multi-factor variance analysis. For example, we will arrange various operational activities on multiple operational channels to evaluate the conversion rate of each channel. At this point, there are two factors that affect the conversion rate, channel and campaign, and we can use "two-way ANOVA without repetition" to examine the data.

#### Application scenarios

The analysis of variance can be used in the following two scenarios at work:

1. Comparison of the indicators of the same customer group before and after implementing a certain strategy.
2. Compare two or more customer groups with the same indicator, and evaluate the differences of the same indicator in different customer groups.

### Parameter Estimation

In the work of product operation, data analysis often encounters many very troublesome situations. For example, the amount of data faced by product operation is often in the millions or tens of millions, which brings about a sharp drop in the analysis speed, the number of runs, etc. One or two days is an ideal situation; in addition, in many scenarios, we can only get part of the data (sample), but not the full amount of data (population). In this case, we must analyze the characteristics of a very small number of samples, and then use these characteristics to evaluate the characteristics of massive overall data, which can be called **sample test**.

**The core of inferential statistics is to use the sample to infer the population**. In the actual production environment, it may not be possible to obtain all the data, or even if all the data is obtained, there are not enough resources to analyze all the data. In this case, we need to use a very small number of sample features to evaluate The characteristics of the population data, one of which is parameter estimation.

There are many scenarios in which parameter estimation is applied, such as:

1. On the product side, we can use parameter estimation to evaluate the effect of A/B testing.
2. On the operational side, we can use parameter estimation to optimize campaign configuration and recommendation strategies.
3. On the market side, we can use parameter estimation to formulate advertising strategies.

#### Implementation steps

1. Determine the confidence level of the analysis

2. Determine the type of parameters to be estimated

3. Calculate the interval of parameter estimates

    - Numerical indicators: $ A = z \times sample standard deviation / \sqrt{sample size} $, where the value of $ z $ can be obtained by looking up the table, if the confidence level is 95%, then the value of $ z $ is 1.96 . Most operational metrics are numerical metrics, such as DAU, ARPU, conversion rate, etc.
    - Proportional indicator: $ A = z \times \sqrt{proportion \times (1 - ratio) / sample size} $, the value of $ z $ is the same as above. Proportional indicators such as gender ratio, channel ratio, category ratio, etc.

    The final estimated interval is: $ [sample mean - A, sample mean + A] $.
