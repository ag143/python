## NumPy application-2

### Array operations

The most convenient thing about using NumPy is that when you need to perform operations on array elements, you don't need to write loop code to traverse each element, all operations will be automatically **vectorized** (using efficient pre-compiled low-level language code to perform data sequence operations) perform mathematical operations). Simply put, mathematical operations and mathematical functions in NumPy are automatically applied to each member of the array.

#### Array and scalar operations

Code:

````Python
array35 = np.arange(1, 10)
print(array35 + 10)
print(array35 * 10)
````

output:

````
[11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19]
[10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90]
````

#### Array and array operations

Code:

````Python
array36 = np.array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])
print(array35 + array36)
print(array35 * array36)
print(array35**array36)
````

output:

````
[ 2 3 4 6 7 8 10 11 12 ]
[ 1 2 3 8 10 12 21 24 27 ]
[ 1 2 3 16 25 36 343 512 729 ]
````

#### Universal unary function

Generic functions are functions that perform element-wise operations on the data in `ndarray`. You can think of it as a vectorized wrapper around a normal function that takes a scalar value as a parameter and returns a scalar value, as shown below.

Code:

````Python
print(np. sqrt(array35))
print(np.log2(array35))
````

output:

````
[1. 1.41421356 1.73205081 2. 2.23606798 2.44948974
 2.64575131 2.82842712 3.]
[0.1.1.5849625 2.2.32192809 2.5849625
 2.80735492 3.3.169925]
````

>**Supplementary Note**: In two-dimensional space, the two vectors $\boldsymbol{A}=\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}=\begin{ The cross product of bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{bmatrix}$ is defined as: $\boldsymbol{A}\times \boldsymbol{B}=\begin{vmatrix} a_1 \quad a_2 \\ b_1 \quad b_2 \ end{vmatrix}=a_1b_2 - a_2b_1$, where $\begin{vmatrix} a_1 \quad a_2 \\ b_1 \quad b_2 \end{vmatrix}$ is called the determinant. But it must be noted that the cross product is not equivalent to the determinant. The result of the determinant operation is a scalar, and the result of the cross product operation is a vector. If we don't understand, we can look at two vectors in three-dimensional space, $\boldsymbol{A}=\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}=\begin{ The cross product of bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix}$ is $\left< \hat{i} \begin{vmatrix} a_2 \quad a_3 \\ b_2 \quad b_3 \end{vmatrix}, - \hat{j} \begin{vmatrix} a_1 \quad a_3 \\ b_1 \quad b_3 \end{vmatrix}, \hat{k} \begin{vmatrix} a_1 \quad a_2 \\ b_1 \quad b_2 \end{vmatrix } \right>$, where $\hat{i}, \hat{j}, \hat{k}$ represent the unit vector of each dimension.

#### Broadcast mechanism

In the above example, the array shapes of the two binary operations are exactly the same. Let's study whether two arrays with different shapes can be directly operated with binary operations or by binary functions. Please see the following example.

Code:

````Python
array39 = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]])
array40 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array39 + array40
````

output:

````
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5],
       [4, 5, 6]])
````

Code:

````Python
array41 = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
array39 + array41
````

output:

````
array([[1, 1, 1],
       [3, 3, 3],
       [5, 5, 5],
       [7, 7, 7]])
````

Through the above example, we found that arrays with different shapes still have the opportunity to perform binary operations, but definitely not any array can perform binary operations. Simply put, the broadcasting mechanism will be triggered only when the dimensions of the trailing edges of the two arrays are the same or one of the trailing edges of the arrays is 1, and binary operations can be performed if the shapes of the two arrays can be made the same through the broadcasting mechanism. The so-called trailing edge dimension refers to the value of the last element in the tuple corresponding to the `shape` attribute of the array (the value of the last dimension from the back to the front). For example, the dimension of the array corresponding to the image we opened before is 3. A 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns has a trailing edge dimension of 4, while a 1D array with 5 elements has a trailing edge dimension of 5. To put it simply, if the dimension of the trailing edge is the same or the dimension of the trailing edge of one of the arrays is 1, the broadcasting mechanism can be applied; and if the broadcasting mechanism can make the shapes of the arrays consistent, it satisfies the operation requirements of the corresponding elements of the two arrays. As shown below.

### Other common functions

In addition to the functions mentioned above, NumPy also provides many functions for processing arrays. Many methods of the `ndarray` object can also be implemented by calling functions directly. The following table shows some commonly used functions.


**Table 3: Other commonly used functions of NumPy**

| Function | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- ------------------- |
| `unique` | Remove duplicate elements from an array and return an ordered array of unique elements |
| `copy` | Returns the array obtained by copying the array |
| `sort` | Returns a sorted copy of the array elements |
| `split` / `hsplit` / `vsplit` | Split array into subarrays |
| `stack` / `hstack` / `vstack` | Stack multiple arrays into a new array |
| `concatenate` | Concatenates multiple arrays along the specified axis to form a new array |
| `append` / `insert` | Append an element to the end of an array / Insert an element at a specified position in the array |
| `argwhere` | Find the position of a non-zero element in an array |
| `extract` / `select` / `where` | Extract or process array elements from an array according to specified conditions |
| `flip` | Flip the elements of the array along the specified axis |
| `fromiter` | Create an array object from an iterator |
| `fromregex` | Creates an array object by reading a file and parsing data from a regular expression |
| `repeat` / `tile` | Create a new array by repeating elements |
| `roll` | Shift array elements along the specified axis |
| `resize` | Resize an array |
| `place` / `put` | Replace the elements in the array that satisfy the condition/specified elements with the specified value |
| `ptp` | Calculates the range (difference between maximum and minimum) along the specified axis |
| `median` | Calculates the median along the specified axis |
| `partition` | Divide the array once with the selected elements and return the divided array |

> **Tip**: The above `resize` function is different from the `resize` method of the `ndarray` object. The `resize` function will repeat the elements in the array as the extra elements when resizing the array. value, and the `resize` method of the `ndarry` object pads the extra elements with 0. It doesn't matter if these small details are unclear for the time being, but if you use the corresponding functions, you should pay attention.

Code:

````Python
array42 = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]])
array43 = np.array([[4, 4, 4], [5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6]])
np.hstack((array42, array43))
````

output:

````
array([[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4],
       [2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5],
       [3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6]])
````

Code:

````Python
np.vstack((array42, array43))
````

output:

````
array([[1, 1, 1],
       [2, 2, 2],
       [3, 3, 3],
       [4, 4, 4],
       [5, 5, 5],
       [6, 6, 6]])
````

Code:

````Python
np.concatenate((array42, array43))
````

output:

````
array([[1, 1, 1],
       [2, 2, 2],
       [3, 3, 3],
       [4, 4, 4],
       [5, 5, 5],
       [6, 6, 6]])
````

Code:

````Python
np.concatenate((array42, array43), axis=1)
````

output:

````
array([[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4],
       [2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5],
       [3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 6]])
````

### Matrix Operations

NumPy provides modules dedicated to linear algebra (linear algebra) and the type `matrix` to represent matrices. Of course, we can also represent a matrix through a two-dimensional array. Officially, the use of the `matrix` class is not recommended, but the use of two dimensional arrays, and the `matrix` class may be removed in a future release. In any case, with these encapsulated classes and functions, we can easily and happily implement many operations in linear algebra.

#### Linear Algebra Quick Review

1. **Vector**, also known as **vector**, is a geometric object that has both size and direction and satisfies the parallelogram law. The concept opposite to the vector is called **scalar** or **quantity**, scalar only has size, in most cases no direction.
2. Vectors can perform operations such as **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **dot product**, and **cross product**.
3. **Determinant** consists of vectors, and its properties can be explained by vectors.
4. The determinant can be calculated using the **determinant formula**: $det(\boldsymbol{A})=\sum_{n!} \pm {a_{1\alpha}a_{2\beta} \cdots a_{ n\omega}}$.
5. High-order determinants can be expanded into multiple low-order determinants with **algebraic cofactors**, such as: $det(\boldsymbol{A})=a_{11}C_{11}+a_{12}C_ {12}+ \cdots +a_{1n}C_{1n}$.
6. **Matrix** is a rectangular array of a series of elements. The elements in the matrix can be numbers, symbols or mathematical formulas.
7. Matrix can perform **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **multiplication**, **transposition** and other operations.
8. **The inverse matrix** is represented by $\boldsymbol{A^{-1}}$, $\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{A^{-1}}=\boldsymbol{A^{-1}} \boldsymbol{A}=\boldsymbol{I}$; a square matrix without an inverse is a **singular matrix**.
9. If a square matrix is ​​a **full rank matrix** (the rank of the matrix is ​​equal to the order of the matrix), the linear equation corresponding to the square matrix has a unique solution.

> **Description**: **The rank of the matrix** refers to the maximum number of linearly independent row/column vectors in the matrix, and it is also the dimension of the image space of the linear transformation corresponding to the matrix.

#### Matrix correlation functions in NumPy

1. Create a matrix object.

    Code:

    ````Python
    # The matrix constructor can pass in an array-like object or a string
    m1 = np.matrix('1 2 3; 4 5 6')
    m1
    ````

    output:

    ````
    matrix([[1, 2, 3],
            [4, 5, 6]])
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    # The asmatrix function can also be written as a mat function, they are actually the same function
    m2 = np.asmatrix(np.array([[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]))
    m2
    ````

    output:

    ````
    matrix([[1, 1],
            [twenty two],
            [3, 3]])
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    m1 * m2
    ````

    output:

    ````
    matrix([[14, 14],
            [32, 32]])
    ````

    > **Note**: Pay attention to the difference between `matrix` object and `ndarray` object multiplication. If two two-dimensional arrays are to be matrix multiplication, you should use `@` operator or `matmul` function instead of ` *` operator.

2. Properties of the matrix object.

    | Properties | Description |
    | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
    | `A` | Get the `ndarray` object corresponding to the matrix object |
    | `A1` | Get the flattened `ndarray` object corresponding to the matrix object |
    | `I` | Inverse of an invertible matrix |
    | `T` | Transpose of a matrix |
    | `H` | Conjugate Transpose of Matrix |
    | `shape` | the shape of the matrix |
    | `size` | number of matrix elements |
	

3. Methods of the matrix object.

  The method of the matrix object is basically the same as the method of the `ndarray` array object mentioned before, and will not be repeated here.
