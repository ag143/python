## NumPy application-1

Numpy is an open source Python scientific computing library for fast processing of arrays of arbitrary dimensions. Numpy **supports common array and matrix operations**. For the same numerical computing task, using NumPy not only makes the code much simpler, but also the performance of NumPy is far superior to that of native Python, which is basically a gap of one to two orders of magnitude. And the larger the amount of data, the more obvious the advantages of NumPy.

The core data type of Numpy is `ndarray`. Using `ndarray` can handle one-dimensional, two-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays. This object is equivalent to a fast and flexible large data container. The underlying code of NumPy is written in C language, which solves the limitation of GIL. When `ndarray` stores data, the addresses of data and data are continuous, which makes batch operations very fast, far superior to Python's `list`; on the other hand, the `ndarray` object provides more methods to process data, especially the methods related to statistics, which are also not available in Python's native `list`.

 ### Preparation

1. Start Notebook

    ````Bash
    jupyter notebook
    ````

    > **Tips**: Before starting the notebook, it is recommended to install the dependencies related to data analysis, including the three artifacts mentioned above and related dependencies, including: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, ` openpyxl`, `xlrd`, `xlwt`, etc. If you use Anaconda, you don't need to install it separately.

2. Import

    ````Python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ````

    > **Note**: If you have already started Notebook but have not installed the relevant dependent libraries, for example, `numpy` has not been installed, you can enter `!pip install numpy` in the cell of Notebook and run the cell to install NumPy. You can install multiple tripartite libraries at once, you need to enter !pip install numpy pandas matplotlib` in the cell. Note that in the code above, we not only imported NumPy, but also the pandas and matplotlib libraries.

### Create array object

There are many ways to create an `ndarray` object, the following describes how to create one-dimensional arrays, two-dimensional arrays, and multi-dimensional arrays.

#### 1D array

- Method 1: Use the `array` function to create an array object through `list`

    Code:

    ````Python
    array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    array1
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    ````

- Method 2: Use the `arange` function to specify the range of values ​​to create an array object

    Code:

    ````Python
    array2 = np.arange(0, 20, 2)
    array2
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([ 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18])
    ````

- Method 3: Use the `linspace` function to create an array object with evenly spaced numbers in the specified range

    Code:

    ````Python
    array3 = np.linspace(-5, 5, 101)
    array3
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([-5. , -4.9, -4.8, -4.7, -4.6, -4.5, -4.4, -4.3, -4.2, -4.1, -4. ,
           -3.9, -3.8, -3.7, -3.6, -3.5, -3.4, -3.3, -3.2, -3.1, -3. , -2.9,
           -2.8, -2.7, -2.6, -2.5, -2.4, -2.3, -2.2, -2.1, -2. , -1.9, -1.8,
           -1.7, -1.6, -1.5, -1.4, -1.3, -1.2, -1.1, -1. , -0.9, -0.8, -0.7,
           -0.6, -0.5, -0.4, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0. , 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
            0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1. , 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5,
            1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2. , 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6,
            2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3. , 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7,
            3.8, 3.9, 4. , 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8,
            4.9, 5. ])
    ````

- Method 4: Use the function of the `numpy.random` module to generate random numbers to create an array object

    Generate 10 random decimals in the range of $[0, 1)$, code:

    ````Python
    array4 = np.random.rand(10)
    array4
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([0.45556132, 0.67871326, 0.4552213 , 0.96671509, 0.44086463,
           0.72650875, 0.79877188, 0.12153022, 0.24762739, 0.6669852 ])
    ````

    Generate 10 random integers in the range $[1, 100)$, code:

    ````Python
    array5 = np.random.randint(1, 100, 10)
    array5
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([29, 97, 87, 47, 39, 19, 71, 32, 79, 34])
    ````

    Generate 20 normally distributed random numbers of $\mu=50$, $\sigma=10$, code:

    ````Python
    array6 = np.random.normal(50, 10, 20)
    array6
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([55.04155586, 46.43510797, 20.28371158, 62.67884053, 61.23185964,
           38.22682148, 53.17126151, 43.54741592, 36.11268017, 40.94086676,
           63.27911699, 46.92688903, 37.1593374 , 67.06525656, 67.47269463,
           23.37925889, 31.45312239, 48.34532466, 55.09180924, 47.95702787])
    ````

> **Description**: There are many other ways to create one-dimensional arrays, such as reading strings, reading files, parsing regular expressions, etc. We will not discuss these methods here, and interested readers can use their own Research.

#### Two-dimensional array

- Method 1: Use the `array` function to create an array object through a nested `list`

    Code:

    ````Python
    array7 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    array7
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    ````


- Method 2: Use `zeros`, `ones`, `full` functions to specify the shape of the array to create an array object

    Using the `zeros` function, the code:

    ````Python
    array8 = np.zeros((3, 4))
    array8
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 0.]])
    ````

    Using the `ones` function, the code:

    ````Python
    array9 = np.ones((3, 4))
    array9
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[1., 1., 1., 1.],
           [1., 1., 1., 1.],
           [1., 1., 1., 1.]])
    ````

    Using the `full` function, the code:

    ````Python
    array10 = np.full((3, 4), 10)
    array10
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[10, 10, 10, 10],
           [10, 10, 10, 10],
           [10, 10, 10, 10]])
    ````

- Method 3: Use the eye function to create an identity matrix

    Code:

    ````Python
    array11 = np.eye(4)
    array11
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[1., 0., 0., 0.],
           [0., 1., 0., 0.],
           [0., 0., 1., 0.],
           [0., 0., 0., 1.]])
    ````

- Method 4: Convert a one-dimensional array into a two-dimensional array by `reshape`

    Code:

    ````Python
    array12 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]).reshape(2, 3)
    array12
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    ````

    > **Tips**: `reshape` is a method of the `ndarray` object. When using the `reshape` method, you need to ensure that the number of array elements after reshaping is the same as the number of array elements before reshaping, otherwise it will generate abnormal.

- Method 5: Create an array object by generating random numbers with the functions of the `numpy.random` module

    Generate a two-dimensional array of 3 rows and 4 columns consisting of random decimals in the range of $[0, 1)$, code:

    ````Python
    array13 = np.random.rand(3, 4)
    array13
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[0.54017809, 0.46797771, 0.78291445, 0.79501326],
           [0.93973783, 0.21434806, 0.03592874, 0.88838892],
           [0.84130479, 0.3566601 , 0.99935473, 0.26353598]])
    ````
	

Generate a two-dimensional array with 3 rows and 4 columns consisting of random integers in the range of $[1, 100)$, code:

    ````Python
    array14 = np.random.randint(1, 100, (3, 4))
    array14
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[83, 30, 64, 53],
           [39, 92, 53, 43],
           [43, 48, 91, 72]])
    ````

#### Multidimensional Arrays

- Create multidimensional arrays in a random way

    Code:

    ````Python
    array15 = np.random.randint(1, 100, (3, 4, 5))
    array15
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[[94, 26, 49, 24, 43],
            [27, 27, 33, 98, 33],
            [13, 73, 6, 1, 77],
            [54, 32, 51, 86, 59]],
    
           [[62, 75, 62, 29, 87],
            [90, 26, 6, 79, 41],
            [31, 15, 32, 56, 64],
            [37, 84, 61, 71, 71]],
    
           [[45, 24, 78, 77, 41],
            [75, 37, 4, 74, 93],
            [ 1, 36, 36, 60, 43],
            [23, 84, 44, 89, 79]]])
    ````

- Reshape a one-dimensional and two-dimensional array into a multi-dimensional array

    A one-dimensional array is reshaped into a multi-dimensional array, the code:

    ````Python
    array16 = np.arange(1, 25).reshape((2, 3, 4))
    array16
    ````

    output:

    ````Python
    array([[[ 1, 2, 3, 4],
            [ 5, 6, 7, 8],
            [ 9, 10, 11, 12]],
    
           [[13, 14, 15, 16],
            [17, 18, 19, 20],
            [21, 22, 23, 24]]])
    ````

    To reshape a two-dimensional array into a multi-dimensional array, the code:

    ````Python
    array17 = np.random.randint(1, 100, (4, 6)).reshape((4, 3, 2))
    array17
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[[60, 59],
            [31, 80],
            [54, 91]],
    
           [[67, 4],
            [4, 59],
            [47, 49]],
    
           [[16, 4],
            [5, 71],
            [80, 53]],
    
           [[38, 49],
            [70, 5],
            [76, 80]]])
    ````

- Read the picture to get the corresponding three-dimensional array

    Code:
    
    ````Python
    array18 = plt.imread('guido.jpg')
    array18
    ````

    output:

    
```
    array([[[ 36,  33,  28],

           [[ 37,  34,  29],
            [ 38,  35,  30],
            [ 38,  35,  30],
            ...,
            [ 31,  30,  28],
            [ 31,  30,  26],

            [ 81,  69,  57],
            [ 79,  67,  53]]], dtype=uint8)
    ```
    
    > **说明**：上面的代码读取了当前路径下名为`guido.jpg` 的图片文件，计算机系统中的图片通常由若干行若干列的像素点构成，而每个像素点又是由红绿蓝三原色构成的，所以能够用三维数组来表示。读取图片用到了`matplotlib`库的`imread`函数。

### 数组对象的属性

1. `size`属性：数组元素个数

    代码：

    ```Python
    array19 = np.arange(1, 100, 2)
    array20 = np.random.rand(3, 4)
    print(array19.size, array20.size)
    ```

    输出：

    ```
    50 12
    ```

2. `shape`属性：数组的形状

    代码：

    ```Python
    print(array19.shape, array20.shape)
    ```

    输出：

    ```
    (50,) (3, 4)
    ```

3. `dtype`属性：数组元素的数据类型

    代码：

    ```Python
    print(array19.dtype, array20.dtype)
    ```

    输出：

    ```
    int64 float64
    ```


The data type of `ndarray` object elements can refer to the table shown below.

    <img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211005114813.png" width="85%">

4. `ndim` property: the dimension of the array

    Code:

    ````Python
    print(array19.ndim, array20.ndim)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    1 2
    ````

5. `itemsize` property: the number of bytes of memory space occupied by a single element of the array

    Code:

    ````Python
    array21 = np.arange(1, 100, 2, dtype=np.int8)
    print(array19.itemsize, array20.itemsize, array21.itemsize)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    8 8 1
    ````

    > **Note**: When using `arange` to create an array object, specify the data type of the elements through the `dtype` parameter. It can be seen that `np.int8` represents an 8-bit signed integer, occupying only 1 byte of memory space, and the value range is $[-128,127]$.

6. `nbytes` property: the number of bytes of memory space occupied by all elements of the array

    Code:

    ````Python
    print(array19.nbytes, array20.nbytes, array21.nbytes)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    400 96 50
    ````

7. `flat` property: iterator over the elements of the array (after one-dimensionalization)

    Code:

    ````Python
    from typing import Iterable
    
    print(isinstance(array20.flat, np.ndarray), isinstance(array20.flat, Iterable))
    ````

    output:

    ````
    False True
    ````

8. `base` property: the base object of the array (if the array shares the memory space of other arrays)

    Code:

    ````Python
    array22 = array19[:]
    print(array22.base is array19, array22.base is array21)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    True False
    ````

    > **Description**: The above code uses the slice operation of the array, which is similar to the slice of the `list` type in Python, but the details are not exactly the same. The following will specifically explain this knowledge point. It can be found from the above code that the new array object obtained after `ndarray` slices shares the data in memory with the original array object, so the `base` property of `array22` is the array object corresponding to `array19`.

### Array indexing and slicing

Similar to lists in Python, NumPy's `ndarray` objects can perform indexing and slicing operations. By indexing, you can get or modify elements in the array, and by slicing, you can take out part of the array.

1. Index operation (normal index)

    One-dimensional array, code:

    ````Python
    array23 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    print(array23[0], array23[array23.size - 1])
    print(array23[-array23.size], array23[-1])
    ````

    output:

    ````
    1 9
    1 9
    ````

    Two-dimensional array, code:

    ````Python
    array24 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    print(array24[2])
    print(array24[0][0], array24[-1][-1])
    print(array24[1][1], array24[1, 1])
    ````

    output:

    ````
    [7 8 9]
    1 9
    5 5
    [[ 1 2 3]
     [ 4 10 6 ]
     [7 8 9]]
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    array24[1][1] = 10
    print(array24)
    array24[1] = [10, 11, 12]
    print(array24)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    [[ 1 2 3]
     [ 4 10 6 ]
     [7 8 9]]
    [[ 1 2 3]
     [10 11 12]
     [7 8 9]]
    ````


2. Slice operation (slice index)

    A slice is a syntax of the form `[start_index:end_index:step_size]` by specifying **start_index** (default infinitesimal), **end_index** (default infinite) and **step_size* * (default 1), take the specified part of the elements from the array and form a new array. Because the start index, end index, and step size all have default values, they can all be omitted, and the second colon can also be omitted if no step size is specified. The slice operation of a one-dimensional array is very similar to the `list` type slice in Python, so I won't repeat it here. For a slice of a two-dimensional array, you can refer to the following code, which is very easy to understand.

    Code:

    ````Python
    print(array24[:2, 1:])
    ````

    output:

    ````
    [[twenty three]
     [5 6]]
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    print(array24[2])
    print(array24[2, :])
    ````

    output:

    ````
    [7 8 9]
    [7 8 9]
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    print(array24[2:, :])
    ````

    output:

    ````
    [[7 8 9]]
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    print(array24[:, :2])
    ````

    output:

    ````
    [[1 2]
     [4 5]
     [7 8]]
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    print(array24[1, :2])
    print(array24[1:2, :2])
    ````

    output:

    ````
    [4 5]
    [[4 5]]
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    print(array24[::2, ::2])
    ````

    output:

    ````
    [[1 3]
     [7 9]]
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    print(array24[::-2, ::-2])
    ````

    output:

    ````
    [[9 7]
     [3 1]]
    ````


Regarding the indexing and slicing operations of arrays, you can enhance your impression through the following two figures, which are from ["Data Analysis with Python"](https://item.jd.com/12398725.html) One Book, which is a classic textbook in the field of Python data analysis written by Wes McKinney, the author of the `pandas` library. Interested readers can purchase and read the original book.

3. fancy index

    Fancy indexing refers to the use of integer arrays for indexing. The integer arrays mentioned here can be `ndarray` of NumPy, or iterable types such as `list` and `tuple` in Python. You can use forward or negative index.

    Fancy indexing of 1D arrays, code:

    ````Python
    array25 = np.array([50, 30, 15, 20, 40])
    array25[[0, 1, -1]]
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([50, 30, 40])
    ````

    Fancy indexing of 2D array, code:

    ````Python
    array26 = np.array([[30, 20, 10], [40, 60, 50], [10, 90, 80]])
    # Take the 1st and 3rd row of the 2D array
    array26[[0, 2]]
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[30, 20, 10],
           [10, 90, 80]])
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    # Take the two elements of the 1st row, 2nd column, 3rd row and 3rd column of the two-dimensional array
    array26[[0, 2], [1, 2]]
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([20, 80])
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    # Take the two elements of the 1st row, 2nd column, 3rd row and 2nd column of the two-dimensional array
    array26[[0, 2], 1]
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([20, 90])
    ````

4. Boolean Index

    Boolean indexing refers to indexing the elements of an array through an array of Boolean type. An array of Boolean type can be constructed manually, or a relational operation can be used to generate an array of Boolean type.

    Code:

    ````Python
    array27 = np.arange(1, 10)
    array27[[True, False, True, True, False, False, False, False, True]]
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([1, 3, 4, 9])
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    array27 >= 5
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([False, False, False, False, True, True, True, True, True])
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    # ~ operator can achieve logical inversion, and see what is the difference between the running result and the above
    ~(array27 >= 5)
    ````
    
    output:
    
    ````
    array([ True, True, True, True, False, False, False, False, False])
    ````
    
    Code:
    
    ````Python
    array27[array27 >= 5]
    ````
    
    output:
    
    ````
    array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    ````

> **Tips**: Although the slicing operation creates a new array object, the new array and the original array share the data in the array. Simply put, if the data in the array is modified through the new array object or the original array object, in fact The same piece of data is modified. Fancy indexing and boolean indexing will also create new array objects, and the new array copies the elements of the original array. The new array and the original array are not in the relationship of shared data. This can also be done through the `base` attribute of the array mentioned above. Understand that you need to pay attention when using it.

#### Example: Image processing by array slicing

Learning the basics is always boring and unfulfilling, so let's take a case to demonstrate the use of the array indexing and slicing operations learned above. As we mentioned earlier, the image can be represented by a three-dimensional array, then by operating the three-dimensional array corresponding to the image, the image processing can be realized, as shown below.

Read in the image to create a three-dimensional array object.

````Python
guido_image = plt.imread('guido.jpg')
plt.imshow(guido_image)
````

Reverse slice the 0-axis of the array to flip the image vertically.

````Python
plt.imshow(guido_image[::-1])
````

![](https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211005115228.png)

Reverse slices the 1-axis of the array to flip the image horizontally.

````Python
plt.imshow(guido_image[:,::-1])
````

![](https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211005115242.png)

Cut out Guido's head.

````Python
plt.imshow(guido_image[30:350, 90:300])
````

### Methods of array objects

#### statistical methods

Statistical methods mainly include: `sum()`, `mean()`, `std()`, `var()`, `min()`, `max()`, `argmin()`, `argmax() )`, `cumsum()`, etc., are used to sum, average, find standard deviation, find variance, find the maximum, find the minimum, and find the cumulative sum of the elements in the array respectively, please refer to the following code.

````Python
array28 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
print(array28.sum())
print(array28.mean())
print(array28.max())
print(array28.min())
print(array28.std())
print(array28.var())
print(array28.cumsum())
````

output:

````
30
3.0
5
1
1.4142135623730951
2.0
[ 1 3 6 10 15 20 24 27 29 30 ]
````

####Other methods

1. `all()` / `any()` method: determine whether all elements of the array are `True` / determine whether the array has elements that are `True`.

2. `astype()` method: Copy the array and convert the elements in the array to the specified type.

3. `dot()` method: implements the dot product operation of one array and another array.

    In mathematics, a dot product, also known as a quantity product or a scalar product, is an algebraic operation that accepts two sequences of numbers of equal length and returns a single number. From an algebraic point of view, first multiply the corresponding elements of each group in the two sequence of numbers, and then sum up all products, the result is the dot product, namely: $\boldsymbol{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{B} = \ sum_{i=1}^{n}a_ib_i$. From a geometric point of view, the dot product is the product of the length of two vectors and the cosine of their included angle, namely: $\boldsymbol{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{B}=|\boldsymbol{A}||\boldsymbol{B }|\cos{\theta}$.

    In Euclidean geometry, the dot product of two Cartesian coordinate vectors is also called **inner product** (inner product). NumPy also provides functions to achieve inner product, but the meaning of inner product is higher than Dot product, dot product is equivalent to a special case of inner product in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, and inner product can be extended to normed vector space.

    Dot product operation of one-dimensional array, code:

    ````Python
    array29 = np.array([3, 4])
    array30 = np.array([5, 6])
    array29.dot(array30)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    39
    ````

    Dot product operation of two-dimensional array, code:

    ````Python
    array31 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    array32 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    array31.dot(array32)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[22, 28],
           [49, 64]])
    ````

    > **Note**: It can be seen that the dot product of a two-dimensional array is a matrix multiplication operation.

4. `dump()` method: save the array to a file, you can use the `load()` function in NumPy to load data from the saved file to create an array.

    Code:

    ````Python
    array31.dump('array31-data')
    array32 = np.load('array31-data', allow_pickle=True)
    array32
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    ````

5. `fill()` method: Fill the specified element into the array.

6. `flatten()` method: flatten a multi-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array.

    Code:

    ````Python
    array32.flatten()
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    ````

7. `nonzero()` method: returns the index of the non-zero element.

8. `round()` method: rounds the elements in the array.

9. The `sort()` method: sorts the array in place.

    Code:

    ````Python
    array33 = np.array([35, 96, 12, 78, 66, 54, 40, 82])
    array33.sort()
    array33
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([12, 35, 40, 54, 66, 78, 82, 96])
    ````

10. `swapaxes()` and `transpose()` methods: Swap the axes specified by the array.

   Code:

   ````Python
   # Specify the two axes that need to be swapped, the order does not matter
   array32.swapaxes(0, 1)
   ````

   output:

   ````
   array([[1, 3, 5],
          [2, 4, 6]])
   ````

   Code:


````Python
    # For two-dimensional arrays, transpose is equivalent to implementing the transpose of the matrix
    array32.transpose()
    ````

    output:

    ````
    array([[1, 3, 5],
           [2, 4, 6]])
    ````

11. `take()` method: Takes the element at the specified index from the array, similar to fancy indexing.

      Code:

      ````Python
      array34 = array33.take([0, 2, -3, -1])
      array34
      ````

      output:

      ````
      array([12, 40, 78, 96])
      ````

12. `tolist()` method: converts an array to a `list` in Python.
