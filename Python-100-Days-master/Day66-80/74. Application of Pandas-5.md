## Pandas application-5

### Application of DataFrame

#### window calculation

The `rolling` method of the `DataFrame` object allows us to place data in the window, and then use functions to operate and process the data in the window. For example, we have obtained the recent data of a stock, and if we want to make a 5-day moving average and a 10-day moving average, we need to set the window first and then perform the calculation. We can use the tripartite library `pandas-datareader` to obtain the data of a specified stock within a certain period of time. The specific operations are as follows.

Install the `pandas-datareader` tripartite library.

````Bash
pip install pandas-datareader
````

Get Baidu (ticker: BIDU) recent stock data from the Stooq website via `get_data_stooq` provided by `pandas-datareader`.

````Python
import pandas_datareader as pdr

baidu_df = pdr.get_data_stooq('BIDU', start='2021-11-22', end='2021-12-7')
baidu_df.sort_index(inplace=True)
baidu_df
````

output:

<img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208205710.png" style="zoom:38%;">

The above `DataFrame` has five columns, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, and `Volume`, which are the opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price and volume of the code stock respectively. Next We perform window calculations on Baidu's stock data.

````Python
baidu_df.rolling(5).mean()
````

output:

<img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208205932.png" style="zoom:38%;">

The data in the `Close` column above is the 5-day moving average we need. Of course, we can also use the following method to directly calculate the 5-day moving average on the `Series` object corresponding to the `Close` column.

````Python
baidu_df.Close.rolling(5).mean()
````

output:

````

#### Correlation determination

In statistics, we usually use covariance to measure the joint variation of two random variables. If the larger value of the variable $X$ mainly corresponds to the larger value of the other variable $Y$, and the smaller values ​​of the two also correspond, then the two variables tend to exhibit similar behavior and the covariance is positive . If larger values ​​of one variable primarily correspond to smaller values ​​of the other variable, the two variables tend to exhibit opposite behavior, with negative covariance. Simply put, the sign of the covariance shows the correlation between two variables. Variance is a special case of covariance, the covariance of a variable with itself.

$$
cov(X,Y) = E((X - \mu)(Y - \upsilon)) = E(X \cdot Y) - \mu\upsilon
$$

If $X$ and $Y$ are statistically independent, then their covariance is 0, because in the case of $X$ and $Y$ being independent:

$$
E(X \cdot Y) = E(X) \cdot E(Y) = \mu\upsilon
$$

The numerical size of the covariance depends on the size of the variable and is usually not easy to explain, but the normal form of the covariance size can show the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables. In statistics, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is the normal form of covariance, which is used to measure the degree of correlation (linear correlation) between two variables $X$ and $Y$, and its value is between `-1 ` to `1`.

$$
\rho{X,Y} = \frac {cov(X, Y)} {\sigma_{X}\sigma_{Y}}
$$

Estimate the covariance and standard deviation of the sample, you can get the sample Pearson coefficient, usually represented by the Greek letter $\rho$.

$$
\rho = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})} {\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n }(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}
$$

We follow the following two steps when judging the correlation of the indicator with the $\rho$ value.

1. Determine whether the indicators are positively correlated, negatively correlated, or irrelevant.
    - When $ \rho \gt 0 $, it is considered that there is a positive correlation between the variables, that is, the trend of the two is the same.
    - When $ \rho \lt 0 $, it is considered that there is a negative correlation between the variables, that is, the trend of the two is opposite.
    - When $ \rho = 0 $, the variables are considered uncorrelated, but it does not mean that the two indicators are statistically independent.
2. Determine the degree of correlation between the indicators.
    - When the absolute value of $ \rho $ is between $ [0.6,1] $, the variables are considered to be strongly correlated.
    - When the absolute value of $ \rho $ is between $ [0.1, 0.6) $, the variables are considered to be weakly correlated.
    - When the absolute value of $ \rho $ is between $ [0,0.1) $, there is no correlation between variables.
	
	

The Pearson correlation coefficient applies to:

 1. There is a linear relationship between the two variables, both of which are continuous data.
 2. The population of the two variables is normally distributed, or a unimodal distribution close to normal.
 3. The observations of the two variables are paired, and each pair of observations is independent of each other.

The `cov` method and the `corr` method of the `DataFrame` object are used to calculate the covariance and correlation coefficient, respectively. The default value of the first parameter `method` of the `corr` method is `pearson`, which means to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient ; in addition, `kendall` or `spearman` can be specified to obtain the Kendall or Spearman rank correlation coefficient.

Next, we take the famous [Boston house price dataset](https://www.heywhale.com/mw/dataset/590bd595812ede32b73f55f2) from the file named `boston_house_price.csv` to create a `DataFrame`, we pass The `corr` method calculates which of the `13` factors that may affect house prices are positively or negatively correlated with house prices. The codes are shown below.

````Python
boston_df = pd.read_csv('data/csv/boston_house_price.csv')
boston_df.corr()
````

> **Note**: If you need the CSV file in the above example, you can get it through the Baidu cloud disk address below. The data is in the "Learn Data Analysis from Scratch" directory. Link: <https://pan.baidu.com/s/1rQujl5RQn9R7PadB2Z5g_g>, extraction code: e7b4.

output:

<img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208213325.png">

The Spearman correlation coefficient does not require stricter data conditions than the Pearson correlation coefficient, as long as the observed values ​​of the two variables are paired graded data, or graded data transformed from continuous variable observations, regardless of the two variables. The overall distribution shape and the size of the sample size can be studied by using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. We calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient in the following way.

````Python
boston_df.corr('spearman')
````

 output:

<img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208213518.png">

In Notebook or JupyterLab, we can add gradient color to the `PRICE` column, and use the color to visually display the columns that are negatively correlated, positively correlated, and irrelevant to the house price. The `background_gradient` method of the `style` property of the `DataFrame` object can To do this, the code is shown below.

````Python
boston_df.corr('spearman').style.background_gradient('RdYlBu', subset=['PRICE'])
````

<img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208215228.png">

The color represented by `RdYlBu` in the above code is shown below. The closer the data value of the correlation coefficient is to `1`, the closer the color is to red; the closer the data value is to `1`, the closer the color is to blue; the data value is `0` Accessories are yellow.

````Python
plt.get_cmap('RdYlBu')
````

### Index Application

Let's take a look at the `Index` type, which provides indexing services for `Series` and `DataFrame` objects. The commonly used `Index` are as follows.

#### RangeIndex

Code:

````Python
sales_data = np.random.randint(400, 1000, 12)
month_index = pd.RangeIndex(1, 13, name='month')
ser = pd.Series(data=sales_data, index=month_index)
ser
````

output:

````
month
1 703
2 705
3 557
4 943
5 961
6 615
7 788
8 985
9 921
10 951
11 874
12 609
dtype: int64
````

#### CategoricalIndex

Code:

````Python
cate_index = pd.CategoricalIndex(
    ['apples', 'bananas', 'apples', 'apples', 'peaches', 'bananas'],
    ordered=True,
    categories=['apples', 'bananas', 'peaches']
)
ser = pd.Series(data=amount, index=cate_index)
ser
````

output:


````
Apple 6
Banana 6
Apple 7
Apple 6
Peaches 8
Banana 6
dtype: int64
````

Code:

````Python
ser.groupby(level=0).sum()
````

output:

````
Apple 19
Banana 12
Peaches 8
dtype: int64
````

#### MultiIndex

Code:

````Python
ids = np.arange(1001, 1006)
sms = ['midterm', 'end of term']
index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product((ids, sms), names=['student number', 'semester'])
courses = ['Chinese', 'Math', 'English']
scores = np.random.randint(60, 101, (10, 3))
df = pd.DataFrame(data=scores, columns=courses, index=index)
df
````

> **Note**: The above code uses the class method `from_product` of `MultiIndex`, which constructs a multi-level index by the Cartesian product of the two sets of data of `ids` and `sms`.

output:

````
             Chinese Mathematics English
Student number Semester
1001 mid-term 93 77 60
      End of period 93 98 84
1002 mid-term 64 78 71
      End of period 70 71 97
1003 mid-term 72 88 97
      End of period 99 100 63
1004 mid-term 80 71 61
      End of period 91 62 72
1005 mid-term 82 95 67
      End of period 84 78 86
````

Code:

````Python
# Calculate the grades of each student, 25% for the mid-term and 75% for the end of the term
df.groupby(level=0).agg(lambda x: x.values[0] * 0.25 + x.values[1] * 0.75)
````

output:

````
        Chinese Mathematics English

1001 93.00 92.75 78.00
1002 68.50 72.75 90.50
1003 92.25 97.00 71.50
1004 88.25 64.25 69.25
1005 83.50 82.25 81.25
````

#### Datetime Index (DatetimeIndex)

1. Through the `date_range()` function, we can create a datetime index, the code is as follows.

    Code:

    ````Python
    pd.date_range('2021-1-1', '2021-6-1', periods=10)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    DatetimeIndex(['2021-01-01 00:00:00', '2021-01-17 18:40:00',
                   '2021-02-03 13:20:00', '2021-02-20 08:00:00',
                   '2021-03-09 02:40:00', '2021-03-25 21:20:00',
                   '2021-04-11 16:00:00', '2021-04-28 10:40:00',
                   '2021-05-15 05:20:00', '2021-06-01 00:00:00'],
                  dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq=None)
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    pd.date_range('2021-1-1', '2021-6-1', freq='W')
    ````
	

output:

    ````
    DatetimeIndex(['2021-01-03', '2021-01-10', '2021-01-17', '2021-01-24',
                   '2021-01-31', '2021-02-07', '2021-02-14', '2021-02-21',
                   '2021-02-28', '2021-03-07', '2021-03-14', '2021-03-21',
                   '2021-03-28', '2021-04-04', '2021-04-11', '2021-04-18',
                   '2021-04-25', '2021-05-02', '2021-05-09', '2021-05-16',
                   '2021-05-23', '2021-05-30'],
                  dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='W-SUN')
    ````

2. Through the `DateOffset` type, we can set the time difference and perform operations with `DatetimeIndex`. The specific operations are as follows.

    Code:

    ````Python
    index = pd.date_range('2021-1-1', '2021-6-1', freq='W')
    index - pd.DateOffset(days=2)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    DatetimeIndex(['2021-01-01', '2021-01-08', '2021-01-15', '2021-01-22',
                   '2021-01-29', '2021-02-05', '2021-02-12', '2021-02-19',
                   '2021-02-26', '2021-03-05', '2021-03-12', '2021-03-19',
                   '2021-03-26', '2021-04-02', '2021-04-09', '2021-04-16',
                   '2021-04-23', '2021-04-30', '2021-05-07', '2021-05-14',
                   '2021-05-21', '2021-05-28'],
                  dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq=None)
    ````

    Code:

    ````Python
    index + pd.DateOffset(days=2)
    ````

    output:

    ````
    DatetimeIndex(['2021-01-05', '2021-01-12', '2021-01-19', '2021-01-26',
                   '2021-02-02', '2021-02-09', '2021-02-16', '2021-02-23',
                   '2021-03-02', '2021-03-09', '2021-03-16', '2021-03-23',
                   '2021-03-30', '2021-04-06', '2021-04-13', '2021-04-20',
                   '2021-04-27', '2021-05-04', '2021-05-11', '2021-05-18',
                   '2021-05-25', '2021-06-01'],
                  dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq=None)
    ````

4. You can use the related methods of the `DatatimeIndex` type to process data, including:
    - `shift()` method: to move data forward or backward by time, we still take the above Baidu stock data as an example, the code is as follows.
    
        Code:
    
        ````Python
        baidu_df.shift(3, fill_value=0)
        ````
    
        output:
    
        <img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208220551.png" style="zoom:150%;">
    
        Code:
    
        ````Python
        baidu_df.shift(-1, fill_value=0)
        ````
    
        output:
    
        <img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208220713.png" style="zoom:150%;">
    
    - `asfreq()` method: Specify a time frequency to extract the corresponding data, the code is as follows.
    
        Code:
    
        ````Python
        baidu_df.asfreq('5D')
        ````
    
        output:
    
        <img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208221202.png">
    
        Code:
    
        ````Python
        baidu_df.asfreq('5D', method='ffill')
        ````
    
        output:
    
        <img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208221249.png" style="zoom:150%;">
    
    - `resample()` method: Resample the data based on time, which is equivalent to grouping the data according to the time period. The code is as follows.
    
        Code:
    
        ````Python
        baidu_df.resample('1M').mean()
        ````
    
        output:
    
        <img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208221429.png">
    
    > **Description**: In the above code, `W` represents a week, `5D` represents `5` days, and `1M` represents `1` month.
	
	
    
5. Time zone conversion
  
     - Get time zone information.
    
         ````Python
         import pytz
        
         pytz.common_timezones
         ````
    
     - `tz_localize()` method: localize datetime.
    
         Code:
    
         ````Python
         baidu_df = baidu_df.tz_localize('Asia/Chongqing')
         baidu_df
         ````
    
         output:
    
         <img src="https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211208221947.png">
    
     - `tz_convert()` method: Convert time zone.
