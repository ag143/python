## Correlation and regression

We know that we can find the reason for the change of the indicator by disassembling the dimensions of the indicator. When we find the cause of the problem, we will naturally think about a further question: there are so many reasons for the change of indicators, which is the key factor? For example, we discuss these issues from time to time in our work scenarios:

1. E-commerce products want to know which category of sales contributes more to the overall sales;
2. Channel operations want to know which channel users have a greater role in overall activity;
3. Those responsible for retention want to know which customer group has a greater relationship with the overall retention;
4. The product wants to know which dimensions (city, age, access devices, etc.) affect overall activity.

There are many similar scenarios, in which we not only need to find the reasons for data changes, but also need to clarify the importance of different reasons. Because of the limited resources available in practical work, we can only focus on superior resources to solve core problems.

### Basic Concepts of Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis refers to the analysis of two or more indicators to assess the degree of connection or mutual influence between them. Correlation analysis can not only analyze whether there is a correlation between multiple indicators, but also give a quantitative value of the degree of correlation. When performing correlation analysis, we will use the "correlation coefficient" to quantitatively give the degree of connection and influence between several indicators, usually expressed by $ \rho $, and the calculation formula is:

$$
\rho = \frac {cov(X, Y)} {\sqrt{var(X) \cdot var(Y)}}
$$
It should be noted that $ \rho $ can only be used to measure the linear relationship, and its value is between $ [-1, 1] $. The outliers in the data will have an impact on $ \rho $, and must be eliminated first in the calculation. When actually using the correlation, you also need to pay attention to the stability of the correlation.

We follow the following two steps when judging the correlation of the indicator with the $ \rho $ value.

1. Determine whether the indicators are positively correlated, negatively correlated, or irrelevant.
    - When $ \rho \gt 0 $, it is considered that there is a positive correlation between the indicators, that is, the trend of the two is the same. If indicator A and indicator B have $ \rho \gt 0 $, then indicator A goes up and indicator B goes up, and vice versa.
    - When $ \rho \lt 0 $, it is considered that there is a negative correlation between the indicators, that is, the trend of the two is opposite. If indicator A and indicator B have $ \rho \lt 0 $, then indicator A goes up and indicator B goes down; and vice versa.
    - When $ \rho = 0 $, the indicators are considered uncorrelated, but it does not mean that the two indicators are statistically independent.
2. Determine the degree of correlation between the indicators.
    - When the value of $ \rho $ is between $ [0.5,1] $, the indicators are considered to be strongly correlated, and the business relationship between indicators is very close.
    - When the value of $ \rho $ is between $ [0.1, 0.5) $, it is considered that the indicators are weakly correlated, and the business relationship between the indicators is not too close.
    - When the value of $ \rho $ is between $ [0,0.1) $, it is considered that there is no correlation between indicators, and there is no business relationship between indicators. That is to say, when we go to operate indicator A, indicator B will not produce corresponding changes.

### Relevant Analysis Application Scenarios

In fact, there are many application scenarios of correlation analysis. Basically, when you ask "what is the relationship between these two things", "which indicator has a greater role (contribution or value)", "which problem should we focus on solving", etc. When there are questions, correlation analysis can be used to give more accurate answers, which is very convenient for product operations to find the core solution to the problem.

When using correlation analysis, you should pay attention to the following aspects:

1. Business sense: When we want to know the situation of the A indicator, we can monitor the B indicator.
2. Matters needing attention: Never judge a correlation as a causal relationship. The correlation is an accompanying relationship rather than a causal relationship.
3. Only strong correlations have business value. It is recommended to look for indicators with correlation coefficients above 0.6 or even 0.8.
4. The essence of the correlation is how much of the change in Y can be explained by X, regardless of the magnitude of the slope between X and Y.

### Excel to calculate the correlation coefficient

1. Method 1: Use the CORREL function.
2. Method 2: Use the "Correlation Coefficient" function of the "Data Analysis" module.

### Related Analysis Cases

#### Analyze which customer group's retention contributes more to overall retention

In the retention operation, we most often look at the retention of new customers and the retention of active customer groups, to evaluate which customer group retention is more closely related to the overall retention, so as to formulate follow-up operation strategies.

The results of the correlation analysis using Excel are shown below.

It can be seen that the retention rate of active visitors has a strong correlation with the overall retention rate; while the retention rate of new visitors has a weak correlation with the overall retention rate, so if we want to improve the overall retention rate, our product operation resources should be More active users will be distributed to improve the overall retention rate; while new visitors will not get a lot of operational resources, we also need to analyze in depth why the contribution of new visitors’ retention is relatively small, and do some work in a timely manner. Strategies to improve this part of the customer base and overall retention.

#### Case 2: Identify the channels that contribute the most to purchase conversions

Basically, e-commerce operations will deploy multiple channels at the same time, including online e-commerce platforms and offline stores. Due to the existing purchase conversion rate of users who acquire customers from various channels for a product, it is necessary to evaluate which channel users contribute the most to the overall purchase conversion rate, and will focus on marketing this channel in the future.

#### Case 3: Analyze which factors have a greater impact on DAU

When we analyze DAU, we often break it down into various dimensions for analysis. Here we analyze which dimensions are most closely related to DAU to help us formulate targeted operation strategies, as shown in the figure below.

For such a report, we need to find out which cities, which operating systems, and which age groups have the greatest impact on DAU. If this relationship can be found, then there will be a very clear direction to improve DAU in the future.


### Linear regression

If there is only one independent variable X, and the quantitative relationship between the dependent variable Y and the independent variable X presents an approximate linear relationship, a univariate linear regression equation can be established, and the value of the dependent variable Y can be predicted by the value of the independent variable X. It is the so-called **monary linear regression prediction**, and the regression equation is as follows:
$$
Y = aX + b
$$
We can use historical data (known $ X $ and $ Y $ ), determine the values ​​of the parameters $ a $ and $ b $, restore the regression equation, so as to achieve prediction. Obviously, there are many choices for the values ​​of $a$ and $b$, so what are the best $a$ and $b$? If the true value is recorded as $ y $, and the predicted value is recorded as $ \hat{y} $, then the $ a $ and $ b $ with the smallest $ SSR $ value are the best $ a $ and $ b $, Call it the **least squares solution**, where the $SSR$ value is calculated as follows:
$$
SSR = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
$$
The loss function is a concave function. To find the values ​​of `a` and `b` that minimize the function, you can find better values ​​of `a` and `b` by approximating the inflection point of the concave function. The specific formula As follows:

$$
a^\prime = a + (-1) \times \frac {\partial loss(a, b)} {\partial a} \times \Delta \\
b^\prime = b + (-1) \times \frac {\partial loss(a, b)} {\partial b} \times \Delta
$$
For the above function to find $SSR$, the partial derivative can be calculated with the following formula:
$$
f(a, b) = \frac {1} {N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i - (ax_i + b))^2 \\
\frac {\partial {f(a, b)}} {\partial {a}} = \frac {2} {N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}(-x_iy_i + x_i^2a + x_ib ) \\
\frac {\partial {f(a, b)}} {\partial {b}} = \frac {2} {N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}(-y_i + x_ia + b)
$$
The above method is called **Gradient Descent**.

In Excel, linear regression can be implemented using "" of the "Data Analysis" module.

For regression analysis, the most important thing is to evaluate whether the regression results are ideal, which is related to whether the regression equation can be used to predict the future. Let's first look at the coefficient of determination (Multiple R-Squared, usually called $ R^2 $). In statistical learning, the coefficient of determination is used to measure the proportion of the change in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable, that is, whether the explanatory power of your regression model is good. The closer the value of $R^2$ is to `1`, the more it is good.
$$
SS_{tot} = \sum_{i}(y_{i} - \bar {y})^2 \\
SS_{res} = \sum_{i}(y_{i} - \hat {y_i})^2 \\
R^2 = 1 - \frac {SS_{res}} {SS_{tot}}
$$

Next, we also need to test the significance of the regression equation, mainly including t test (regression coefficient test) and F test (regression equation test). For the results of the F-statistic (F-statistic), we mainly focus on its p-value. If the p-value is less than 0.05, it means that the fitting effect is good.
