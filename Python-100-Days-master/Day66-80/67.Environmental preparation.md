## Environment preparation

If you want to quickly start using Python for data science related work, it is recommended that you install Anaconda directly, and then use the integrated Notebook or JupyterLab tools in Anaconda to write code. Because for beginners, it will be troublesome to install the official Python interpreter first, and then install the third-party library files that will be used in the work one by one. Especially in the Windows environment, the installation often fails due to the lack of build tools or DLL files. , and it is difficult for the general novice to take correct solutions according to the error message, which is prone to serious frustration.

### Install and use Anaconda

For individual users, you can download its "Individual Edition" installer from Anaconda's [official website] (https://www.anaconda.com/). After the installation is complete, you will not only have It has a Python environment and Spyder (an integrated development tool similar to PyCharm), and also has nearly 200 toolkits related to data science work, including the three major artifacts of Python data analysis we mentioned above. In addition, Anaconda also provides a package management tool called conda, through which you can not only manage Python toolkits, but also create a virtual environment for running Python programs.

As shown in the figure above, you can select the installer suitable for your operating system through the download link provided by the Anaconda official website. It is recommended that you choose the graphical installer. After the download is complete, double-click the installer to start the installation. The installation process basically uses the default settings. After the installation is completed, macOS users can find an application named "Anaconda-Navigator" in "Applications" or "Launchpad", and run the program to see the interface shown below, Here we can choose what needs to be done.

For Windows users, it is recommended to install Anaconda according to the prompts and recommended options of the installation wizard (except for the installation path, there is basically nothing to choose). After the installation is complete, you can find "Anaconda3" in the "Start Menu".

#### conda command

If you want to use the conda tool to manage dependencies or create a virtual environment for your project, you can use the conda command from a terminal or command line prompt. Windows users can find "Anaconda3" in the "Start Menu" and click "Anaconda Prompt" to launch a command line prompt that supports conda. macOS users are recommended to directly use "Environments" in "Anaconda-Navigator" to manage virtual environments and dependencies in a visual way.

1. Version and help information.

    - View version: `conda -V` or `conda --version`
    - For help: `conda -h` or `conda --help`
    - Related information: `conda list`

2. Virtual environment related.

    - Show all virtual environments: `conda env list`
    - Create a virtual environment: `conda create --name venv`
    - Specify the Python version to create a virtual environment: `conda create --name venv python=3.7`
    - Specify the Python version to create a virtual environment and install the specified dependencies: `conda create --name venv python=3.7 numpy pandas`
    - Create a virtual environment by cloning an existing virtual environment: `conda create --name venv2 --clone venv`
    - Share the virtual environment and redirect to the specified file: `conda env export > environment.yml`
    - Create a virtual environment from the shared virtual environment file: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
    - Activate the virtual environment: `conda activate venv`
    - Exit the virtual environment: `conda deactivate`
    - Remove virtual environment: `conda remove --name venv --all`

    > **Note**: In the above command, `venv` and `venv2` are the names of the virtual environment folders, you can replace them with your favorite names, but **strongly recommend** to use English without spaces or other special characters.

3. Package (triple-party library or tool) management.

    - View installed packages: `conda list`
    - Search for the specified package: `conda search matplotlib`
    - Install the specified package: `conda install matplotlib`
    - Update the specified package: `conda update matplotlib`
    - Remove the specified package: `conda remove matplotlib`

    > **Note**: When searching, installing and updating software packages, it will be connected to the official website by default. If you feel that the speed is not good, you can replace the default official website with a domestic mirror website. It is recommended to use Tsinghua University's website. Open source mirror website. The command to replace the default source with a domestic mirror is: `conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free/ `. If you need to switch back to the default source, you can use the command `conda config --remove-key channels`.

### Using Notebook

#### Install and start Notebook

If Anaconda has been installed, macOS users can directly start "Jupyter Notebook" (hereinafter referred to as Notebook) in "Anaconda-Navigator" as described above. Windows users can find the Anaconda folder in the "Start Menu", then select "Jupyter Notebook" in the run folder to start the journey of data science exploration.

For users who have installed the Python environment but do not have Anaconda installed, you can use the Python package management tool `pip` to install `jupyter`, and then run the `jupyter notebook` command in the terminal (command line prompt on Windows) to start the Notebook ,As follows.

Install Notebook:

````Bash
pip install jupyter
````

Install three artifacts:

````Bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
````

Run Notebook:

````Bash
jupyter notebook
````


Notebook is a web-based application for interactive computing, which can be used for code development, document writing, code execution and result display. Simply put, you can **write code** and **run code** directly in the web page, and the running result of the code will also be displayed directly below the code block. If you need to write a description document in the process of writing code, you can write it in Markdown format on the same page, and you can directly see the rendering effect. In addition, Notebook was originally designed to provide a working environment that can support multiple programming languages, and it currently supports more than 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, Scala, and more.

First, we can create a Notebook for writing Python code, as shown in the image below.

#### Notebook tips

If you use Python for engineering project development, PyCharm is definitely the best choice. It provides all the functions that an integrated development environment should have, especially intelligent prompts, code completion, and automatic error correction. feel very comfortable. If you use Python to do data science related work, Notebook is not inferior to PyCharm, and Notebook is better in data and chart presentation. The use of this tool is very simple. You can look at the Notebook menu bar. I believe it will not be too difficult to understand. There is an article on Zhihu called ["The Most Detailed User Guide: Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook Super Fast"](https: //zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/32320214) articles can also help you quickly understand Notebook.

> **Note**: [Jupyter official website](https://jupyter.org/) there is also a tool called JupyterLab, called "Next-Generation Notebook", the user interface is more friendly than Notebook, Interested readers can use the `pip install jupyterlab` command to install this tool, and then start it with `jupyter lab`.

Below I will introduce some notebook usage skills for you, hoping to help you improve your work efficiency.

1. Autocomplete. When writing code in Notebook, press the `Tab` key to get code hints.

2. Get help. When using Notebook, if you want to know the relevant information or usage of an object (such as variable, class, function, etc.), you can use `?` behind the object and run the code, the corresponding information will be displayed at the bottom of the window to help us understand the object, as shown below.

    ![](https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211005113848.png)

3. Search for the name. If you only remember part of a class or a function name, you can use the wildcard `*` with `?` to search, as shown below.

4. Invoke the command. You can use `!` followed by system commands in Notebook to execute system commands.

5. Magic Commands. There are a lot of very interesting and useful magic instructions in Notebook, for example, you can use `%timeit` to test the execution time of a statement, you can use `%pwd` to view the current working directory, etc. If you want to view all the magic commands, you can use `%lsmagic`, if you understand the usage of magic commands, you can use `%magic` to view, as shown in the following figure.

    ![](https://gitee.com/jackfrued/mypic/raw/master/20211005113825.png)

    Commonly used magic commands are:

    | Magic Command | Function Description |
    | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----- ------------------------------------- |
    | `%pwd` | View current working directory |
    | `%ls` | List the contents of the current or specified folder |
    | `%cat` | View the contents of the specified file |
    | `%hist` | View input history |
    | `%matplotlib inline` | Sets the statistical graph to embed matplotlib output in the page |
    | `%config Inlinebackend.figure_format='svg'` | Set the statistic chart to use SVG format (vector) |
    | `%run` | Run the specified program |
    | `%load` | Load the specified file into the cell |
    | `%quickref` | Display IPython quick reference |
    | `%timeit` | Run the code multiple times and count the code execution time |
    | `%prun` | Use `cProfile.run` to run code and display profiler output |
    | `%who` / `%whos` | Show variables in namespace |
    | `%xdel` | deletes an object and clears all references to it |
	
6. Shortcut keys. Many operations in Notebook can be achieved through shortcut keys, and using shortcut keys can improve work efficiency. Notebook shortcut keys can be divided into shortcut keys in command mode and shortcut keys in edit mode. The so-called edit mode is the mode in which code is entered or a document is written. Press `Esc` in edit mode to return to command mode. Press `Enter` in command mode to enter edit mode.

    Shortcut keys in command mode:

    | Shortcut keys | Function description |
    | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- --------------------------- |
    | Alt + Enter (Option + Enter) | Run current cell and insert new cell below |
    | Shift + Enter | Run the current cell and select the cell below |
    | Ctrl + Enter (Command + Enter) | Run current cell |
    | j / k, Shift + j / Shift + k | Select lower/upper cells, consecutively select lower/upper cells |
    | a / b | Insert new cell below/above |
    | c / x | Copy Cell / Cut Cell |
    | v / Shift + v | Paste cells below/above |
    | dd / z | delete cells / undelete cells |
    | l / Shift + l | Show or hide current/all cell row numbers |
    | ii/00 | Interrupt/Restart Notebook Kernel |
    | Space / Shift + Space | Scroll page down/up |

    Shortcuts in edit mode:

    | Shortcut keys | Function description |
    | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
    | Shift + Tab | Get tips |
    | Ctrl + ] (Command + ]) / Ctrl + [ (Command + [) | Increase/decrease indent |
    | Alt + Enter (Option + Enter) | Run current cell and insert new cell below |
    | Shift + Enter | Run the current cell and select the cell below |
    | Ctrl + Enter (Command + Enter) | Run current cell |
    | Ctrl + Left/Right (Command + Left/Right) | Move cursor to start/end of line |
    | Ctrl + Up/Down (Command + Up/Down) | Cursor moves to the beginning/end of code |
    | Up / Down | Move the cursor up/down a line or to the previous/next cell |

    > **Tips**: If you can't remember these shortcut keys, it doesn't matter. Press `h` in command mode to open the notebook's help system, and you can see the shortcut key settings immediately, and you can follow the actual settings. The shortcut keys need to be re-edited, as shown in the following figure.
