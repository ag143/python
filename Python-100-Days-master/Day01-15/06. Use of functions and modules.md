## Use of functions and modules

Before explaining the content of this chapter, let's study a mathematical problem. Please say how many sets of positive integer solutions to the following equation.

![$$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 8$$](./res/formula_3.png)

In fact, the above question is equivalent to how many options are there for dividing 8 apples into four groups of at least one apple each. The answer to this question comes to mind.

![$$C_M^N =\frac{M!}{N!(M-N)!}, \text{(M=7, N=3)} $$](./res/formula_4.png)

This value can be calculated using a Python program, as shown below.

````Python
"""
Enter M and N to calculate C(M,N)

Version: 0.1
Author: Luo Hao
"""
m = int(input('m = '))
n = int(input('n = '))
fm = 1
for num in range(1, m + 1):
    fm *= num
fn = 1
for num in range(1, n + 1):
    fn *= num
fm_n = 1
for num in range(1, m - n + 1):
    fm_n *= num
print(fm // fn // fm_n)
````

### What the function does

I don't know if you have noticed that in the above code, we do the factorial 3 times, and this code is actually repeated code. The programming guru *Martin Fowler* once said: "**Code has many bad smells, and repetition is the worst one!**", to write high-quality code, the first thing to solve is the problem of repeated code. For the above code, we can encapsulate the function of calculating factorial into a function module called "function". Where we need to calculate factorial, we only need to "call" this "function".

### define function

In Python, you can use the `def` keyword to define functions. Like variables, each function also has a loud name, and the naming rules are consistent with the naming rules for variables. The parameters passed to the function can be placed in the parentheses after the function name, which is very similar to the function in mathematics. The parameters of the function in the program are equivalent to the arguments of the function in mathematics, and after the function is executed, we can Use the `return` keyword to return a value, which is mathematically equivalent to the dependent variable of a function.

After understanding how to define functions, we can refactor the above code. The so-called refactoring is to adjust the structure of the code without affecting the execution result of the code. The refactored code is as follows.

````Python
"""
Enter M and N to calculate C(M,N)

Version: 0.1
Author: Luo Hao
"""
def fac(num):
    """Find the factorial"""
    result = 1
    for n in range(1, num + 1):
        result *= n
    return result


m = int(input('m = '))
n = int(input('n = '))
# When you need to calculate the factorial, you don't need to write a loop to find the factorial, but directly call the defined function
print(fac(m) // fac(n) // fac(m - n))
````

> **Note:** Python's `math` module already has a function called `factorial` that implements the factorial operation. In fact, you don't need to define your own function to find the factorial. In the following example, the functions we are talking about have already been implemented in the Python standard library. We implement them again to explain the definition and use of functions. **This kind of low-level repetition is not recommended in actual development. labor**.


### Function parameters

A function is a "building block" of a code that is supported in most programming languages, but there are still many differences between functions in Python and functions in other languages. One of the notable differences is that Python has a Handling of parameters. In Python, function parameters can have default values, and variable parameters are also supported, so Python does not need to support [function overloading] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5) like other languages. %87%BD%E6%95%B0%E9%87%8D%E8%BD%BD), because when we define a function, it can be used in many different ways. Here are two small examples.

````Python
from random import randint


def roll_dice(n=2):
    """Shake the dice"""
    total = 0
    for _ in range(n):
        total += randint(1, 6)
    return total


def add(a=0, b=0, c=0):
    """Add three numbers"""
    return a + b + c


# If no parameter is specified then use the default value to shake two dice
print(roll_dice())
# shake three dice
print(roll_dice(3))
print(add())
print(add(1))
print(add(1, 2))
print(add(1, 2, 3))
# When passing parameters, you can pass them in different order
print(add(c=50, a=100, b=200))
````


We have set default values ​​for the parameters of the above two functions, which means that if the function is called without passing in the value of the corresponding parameter, the default value of the parameter will be used, so in the above code we The `add` function can be called in a variety of different ways, which is consistent with the effect of function overloading in many other languages.

In fact, the above `add` function has a better implementation scheme, because we may add 0 or more parameters, and the specific number of parameters is determined by the caller. As the designer of the function, we need to This is ignorant, so when we are not sure about the number of parameters, we can use variadic parameters, the code is as follows.

````Python
# The * in front of the parameter name indicates that args is a variable parameter
def add(*args):
    total = 0
    for val in args:
        total += val
    return total


# You can pass 0 or more parameters when calling the add function
print(add())
print(add(1))
print(add(1, 2))
print(add(1, 2, 3))
print(add(1, 3, 5, 7, 9))
````

### Manage functions with modules

Naming identifiers like variables and functions can be a headache for any programming language, because we get embarrassed by naming collisions. The simplest scenario is to define two functions with the same name in the same .py file. Since Python does not have the concept of function overloading, the later definitions will overwrite the previous ones, which means that the two functions with the same name actually only have One is there.

````Python
def foo():
    print('hello, world!')


def foo():
    print('goodbye, world!')


# What will the following code output?
foo()
````

Of course, we can easily avoid the above situation, but if the project is developed by multiple people in a collaborative team, there may be multiple programmers in the team who have defined a function named `foo`, then how to solve this problem What about a naming conflict? The answer is actually very simple. Each file in Python represents a module. We can have functions with the same name in different modules. When using functions, we can distinguish them by importing the specified module through the `import` keyword. Which module's `foo` function to use, the code is shown below.

`module1.py`

````Python
def foo():
    print('hello, world!')
````

`module2.py`

````Python
def foo():
    print('goodbye, world!')
````

`test.py`

````Python
from module1 import foo

# print hello, world!
foo()

from module2 import foo

# output goodbye, world!
foo()
````

It is also possible to distinguish which `foo` function to use as shown below.

`test.py`

````Python
import module1 as m1
import module2 as m2

m1.foo()
m2.foo()
````

But if the code is written like the following, the program will call the last imported `foo`, because the latter imported foo overwrites the previously imported `foo`.

`test.py`

````Python
from module1 import foo
from module2 import foo

# output goodbye, world!
foo()
````

`test.py`

````Python
from module2 import foo
from module1 import foo

# print hello, world!
foo()
````

It should be noted that if the module we import has executable code in addition to defining functions, then the Python interpreter will execute the code when importing the module. In fact, we may not want this, so if we are in the module The execution code is written in , it is best to put these execution codes into the conditions shown below, so unless the module is run directly, these codes under the if condition will not be executed, because only the name of the directly executed module It is &quot;\_\_main\_\_&quot;.

`module3.py`

```Python
def foo():
    pass


def bar():
    pass


# __name__ is an implicit variable in Python that represents the name of the module
# Only the name of the module directly executed by the Python interpreter is __main__
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('call foo()')
    foo()
    print('call bar()')
    bar()
````

`test.py`

````Python
import module3

# When importing module3, the code in the module when the if condition is true will not be executed because the name of the module is module3 instead of __main__
````

### practise

#### Exercise 1: Implement the functions that compute the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple.

Reference answer:

````Python
def gcd(x, y):
    """Find the greatest common divisor"""
    (x, y) = (y, x) if x > y else (x, y)
    for factor in range(x, 0, -1):
        if x % factor == 0 and y % factor == 0:
            return factor


def lcm(x, y):
    """Least common multiple"""
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)
````

#### Exercise 2: Implement a function that determines whether a number is a palindrome.

Reference answer:

````Python
def is_palindrome(num):
    """Determine whether a number is a palindrome"""
    temp = num
    total = 0
    while temp > 0:
        total = total * 10 + temp % 10
        temp //= 10
    return total == num
````

#### Exercise 3: Implement a function that determines whether a number is prime or not.

Reference answer:

````Python
def is_prime(num):
    """Determine whether a number is prime or not"""
    for factor in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % factor == 0:
            return False
    return True if num != 1 else False
````

#### Exercise 4: Write a program to determine whether an input positive integer is a palindromic prime.

Reference answer:

````Python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    num = int(input('Please enter a positive integer: '))
    if is_palindrome(num) and is_prime(num):
        print('%d is a palindrome prime' % num)
````

> **Note**: It can be seen from the above program that when we **extract the repeated and relatively independent functions in the code into functions**, we can **combination and use these functions** to solve more complex problems. For complex problems, this is a very important reason why we define and use functions.

### Variable scope

Finally, let's talk about variable scoping in Python.

````Python
def foo():
    b = 'hello'

    # In Python, you can redefine functions inside functions
    def bar():
        c = True
        print(a)
        print(b)
        print(c)

    bar()
    # print(c) # NameError: name 'c' is not defined


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = 100
    # print(b) # NameError: name 'b' is not defined
    foo()
````

The above code can be executed smoothly and print out 100, hello and True, but we noticed that the two variables `a` and `b` are not defined inside the `bar` function, then `a` and `b` where did it come from. We define a variable `a` in the `if` branch of the above code, which is a global variable and belongs to the global scope because it is not defined in any function. In the `foo` function above, we define the variable `b`, which is a local variable defined in the function, which belongs to the local scope and cannot be accessed outside the `foo` function; but For the `bar` function inside the `foo` function, the variable `b` belongs to the nested scope, and we can access it in the `bar` function. The variable `c` in the `bar` function is of local scope and cannot be accessed outside the `bar` function. In fact, when Python looks for a variable, it searches in the order of "local scope", "nested scope", "global scope", and "built-in scope", the first three of which we have seen in the code above. Now, the so-called "built-in scope" are those identifiers built into Python. The `input`, `print`, `int`, etc. we used before belong to the built-in scope.

Looking at the following code again, we want to modify the value of the global variable `a` through the function call, but in fact the following code cannot do it.

````Python
def foo():
    a = 200
    print(a) # 200


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = 100
    foo()
    print(a) # 100
````

After calling the `foo` function, we find that the value of `a` is still 100, this is because when we write `a = 200` in the function `foo`, it redefines a name named `a` A local variable, which is not the same variable as the `a` in the global scope, because the local scope has its own variable `a`, so the `foo` function no longer searches for `a` in the global scope. If we wish to modify `a` in the global scope in the `foo` function, the code looks like this.

````Python
def foo():
    global a
    a = 200
    print(a) # 200


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = 100
    foo()
    print(a) # 200
````

We can use the `global` keyword to indicate that the variable `a` in the `foo` function comes from the global scope. If there is no `a` in the global scope, the following line of code will define the variable `a` and will It is placed in the global scope. Similarly, if we want the function inside the function to modify the variable in the nested scope, we can use the `nonlocal` keyword to indicate that the variable comes from the nested scope, please try it yourself.

In actual development, we should minimize the use of global variables, because the scope and influence of global variables are too extensive, and unexpected modifications and uses may occur. In addition, global variables have longer than local variables. Life cycle, which may cause the memory occupied by the object to be unable to be [garbage collection] for a long time (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9E%83%E5%9C%BE%E5%9B%9E%E6 %94%B6_(%E8%A8%88%E7%AE%97%E6%A9%9F%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%B8)). In fact, reducing the use of global variables is also an important measure to reduce the degree of coupling between codes, and it is also an important measure for the [Law of Demeter](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%BE %97%E5%A2%A8%E5%BF%92%E8%80%B3%E5%AE%9A%E5%BE%8B) practice. Reducing the use of global variables means that we should try to keep the scope of the variable inside the function, but if we want to extend the life cycle of a local variable so that its value can still be used after the function call that defines it ends , then you need to use [closure](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%97%AD%E5%8C%85_(%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6 %9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6)), which we will explain in the following content.

> **Note:** Many people often associate "closures" with ["anonymous functions"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8C%BF%E5%90%8D%E5 %87%BD%E6%95%B0), but in fact they are not the same thing, if you want to understand this concept, you can look at [Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/) The explanation or the discussion of this concept on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/).

Having said so much, the conclusion is actually very simple. From now on, we can write Python code in the following format. This little improvement is actually a huge step on the basis of our understanding of functions and scopes.

````Python
def main():
    # Todo: Add your code here
    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````
