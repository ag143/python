## use regular expressions

### Regular expression related knowledge

When writing programs or web pages that process strings, there is often a need to find strings that meet some complex rules. Regular expressions are tools used to describe these rules. In other words, regular expressions are a tool that Defines the matching pattern of strings (how to check if a string has parts that match a pattern or extract or replace parts that match a pattern from a string). If you have used file lookup in Windows operating system and used wildcards (\* and ?) when specifying filenames, then regular expressions are also similar tools for text matching, but compared to wildcard regular expressions Expressions are more powerful and describe your needs more precisely (of course the price you pay is that writing a regular expression is a lot more complicated than typing a wildcard, know that anything that gives you a benefit comes at a price , just like learning a programming language), for example you can write a regular expression that finds all numbers starting with 0, followed by 2-3 numbers, then a hyphen "-", and finally 7 or 8 A string of digits (like 028-12345678 or 0813-7654321), isn't this the domestic landline number. In the beginning, computers were born to perform mathematical operations, and the information processed is basically numerical values. Today, the information we process in our daily work is basically text data. We hope that computers can recognize and process text that conforms to certain patterns. , the regular expression is very important. Almost all programming languages ​​today provide support for regular expression operations, and Python supports regular expression operations through the re module in the standard library.

We can consider the following problem: We have obtained a string from somewhere (maybe a text file, maybe a news item on the Internet), and we want to find the mobile and landline numbers in the string. Of course, we can set the mobile phone number to be an 11-digit number (note that it is not a random 11-digit number, because you have never seen a mobile phone number like "25012345678") and the landline number is the same as the mode described in the previous paragraph, if not Using regular expressions to accomplish this task would be cumbersome.

Regarding the knowledge of regular expressions, you can read a very famous blog called ["Regular Expressions 30-minute introductory tutorial"](https://deerchao.net/tutorials/regex/regex.htm), after reading this After this article you can understand the following table, which is our brief summary of some of the basic symbols in regular expressions.

| Symbol | Explanation | Example | Explanation |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------- ----------------------------- |
| . | matches any character | b.t | can match bat / but / b#t / b1t etc |
| \\w | matches letters/numbers/underscores | b\\wt | can match bat/b1t/b_t etc<br> but not b#t |
| \\s | matches whitespace characters (including \r, \n, \t, etc.) | love\\syou | can match love you |
| \\d | matches numbers | \\d\\d | can match 01/23/99 etc. |
| \\b | matches word boundaries | \\bThe\\b | |
| ^ | matches the beginning of the string | ^The | can match the string starting with The |
| $ | matches the end of the string | .exe$ | can match the end of the .exe string |
| \\W | matches non-alphanumeric/underscore | b\\Wt | can match b#t/b@t etc<br> but not but/b1t/b_t etc |
| \\S | matches non-whitespace characters | love\\Syou | can match love#you etc<br> but not love you |
| \\D | matches non-digits | \\d\\D | can match 9a / 3# / 0F etc |
| \\B | matches non-word boundaries | \\Bio\\B | |
| [] | matches any single character from the character set | [aeiou] | can match any vowel character |
| [^] | matches any single character not in the character set | [^aeiou] | matches any non-vowel character |
| * | matches 0 or more times | \\w* | |
| + | matches 1 or more times | \\w+ | |
| ? | matches 0 or 1 times | \\w? | |
| {N} | matches N times | \\w{3} | |
| {M,} | matches at least M times | \\w{3,} | |
| {M,N} | matches at least M times at most N times | \\w{3,6} | |
| \| | branch | foo\|bar | can match foo or bar |
| (?#) | Comments | | |
| (exp) | Match exp and capture into automatically named groups | | |
| (?&lt;name&gt;exp) | Match exp and capture into group named name | | |
| (?:exp) | matches exp but does not capture the matched text | | |
| (?=exp) | Matches the position before exp | \\b\\w+(?=ing) | Can match danc in I'm dancing |
| (?<=exp) | matches the position after exp | (?<=\\bdanc)\\w+\\b | can match the first ing in I love dancing and reading |
| (?!exp) | matches a position that is not followed by exp | | |
| (?<!exp) | matches a position not preceded by exp | | |
| *? | Repeat any number of times, but as few times as possible | a.\*b<br>a.\*?b | Apply a regular expression to aabab, the former will match the entire string aabab, the latter will match aab and ab two strings |
| +? | Repeat 1 or more times, but as little as possible | | |
| ?? | Repeat 0 or 1, but as little as possible | | |
| {M,N}? | Repeat M to N times, but as little as possible | | |
| {M,}? | Repeat more than M times, but as little as possible | | |

> **Description:** If the characters to be matched are special characters in the regular expression, you can use \\ for escape processing. For example, if you want to match the decimal point, you can write \\. That's it, because writing . directly will match Any character; similarly, to match parentheses must be written as \\( and \\), otherwise the parentheses are treated as groupings in the regular expression.

### Python support for regular expressions

Python provides the re module to support regular expression related operations. The following are the core functions in the re module.

| Function | Description |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---- -------------------------------------------------- ------ |
| compile(pattern, flags=0) | Compile the regular expression and return the regular expression object |
| match(pattern, string, flags=0) | Use regular expression to match the string, return the matching object successfully, otherwise return None |
| search(pattern, string, flags=0) | Search for the pattern of the first occurrence of the regular expression in the string Return the matching object successfully, otherwise return None |
| split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0) | split the string with the pattern delimiter specified by the regular expression return list |
| sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0) | Use the specified string to replace the pattern matching the regular expression in the original string You can use count to specify the number of times of replacement |
| fullmatch(pattern, string, flags=0) | full match (from beginning to end of string) version of match function |
| findall(pattern, string, flags=0) | Find all patterns in a string that match the regular expression Return a list of strings |
| finditer(pattern, string, flags=0) | finds all patterns in the string that match the regular expression return an iterator |
| purge() | purges the cache of implicitly compiled regular expressions |
| re.I / re.IGNORECASE | Ignore case matching tokens |
| re.M / re.MULTILINE | Multi-line match token |

> **Description:** These functions in the re module mentioned above can also be used to replace the use of these functions with the method of regular expression objects in actual development. If a regular expression needs to be used repeatedly, first pass The compile function compiles the regular expression and creates a regular expression object is undoubtedly a more sensible choice.

Below we will show you how to use regular expressions in Python through a series of examples.

#### Example 1: Verify whether the input user name and QQ number are valid and give the corresponding prompt information.

````Python
"""
Verify whether the entered user name and QQ number are valid and give the corresponding prompt information

Requirements: The user name must be composed of letters, numbers or underscores and the length is between 6 and 20 characters. The QQ number is a number between 5 and 12 and the first position cannot be 0.
"""
import re


def main():
    username = input('Please enter username: ')
    qq = input('Please enter the QQ number: ')
    # The first parameter of the match function is a regular expression string or a regular expression object
    # The second parameter is the string object to be matched against the regular expression
    m1 = re.match(r'^[0-9a-zA-Z_]{6,20}$', username)
    if not m1:
        print('Please enter a valid username.')
    m2 = re.match(r'^[1-9]\d{4,11}$', qq)
    if not m2:
        print('Please enter a valid QQ number.')
    if m1 and m2:
        print('The information you entered is valid!')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

> **Tips:** The above uses the "original string" writing method (r is added in front of the string) when writing the regular expression. The so-called "original string" means that each character in the string is Its original meaning, to put it more directly, is that there is no so-called escape character in the string. Because there are many metacharacters in regular expressions and places that need to be escaped, if you do not use raw strings, you need to write backslashes as \\\\, for example, \\d for numbers must be written as \\\\d , which is not only inconvenient to write, but also very difficult to read.

#### Example 2: Extract the domestic mobile phone number from a piece of text.

The following picture shows the mobile phone number segments launched by the three domestic operators by the end of 2017.

![](./res/tel-start-number.png)

````Python
import re


def main():
    # Create a regular expression object Use look-ahead and look-back to ensure that numbers should not appear before and after the phone number
    pattern = re.compile(r'(?<=\D)1[34578]\d{9}(?=\D)')
    sentence = '''
    Important things have been said 8130123456789 times, my mobile phone number is 13512346789, this pretty number,
    It's not 15600998765, it's also 110 or 119. Wang Dazhui's mobile phone number is 15600998765.
    '''
    # Find all matches and save to a list
    mylist = re.findall(pattern, sentence)
    print(mylist)
    print('-------Ornate divider-------')
    # Take out the matching object through the iterator and get the matching content
    for temp in pattern.finditer(sentence):
        print(temp.group())
    print('-------Ornate divider-------')
    # Find all matches by specifying the search location with the search function
    m = pattern.search(sentence)
    while m:
        print(m.group())
        m = pattern.search(sentence, m.end())


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

> **Note:** The above regular expression for matching domestic mobile phone numbers is not good enough, because numbers starting with 14 are only 145 or 147, and the above regular expression does not consider this situation. To match domestic mobile phone numbers, A better regular expression would be: `(?<=\D)(1[38]\d{9}|14[57]\d{8}|15[0-35-9]\d{ 8}|17[678]\d{8})(?=\D)`, it seems that there are mobile phone numbers starting with 19 and 16 in China recently, but this is not in our consideration for the time being.

#### Example 3: Replace bad content in a string

````Python
import re


def main():
    sentence = 'Are you an idiot? I fuck you. Fuck you.'
    Purified = re.sub('[Fucking]|fuck|shit|Silly [better than a cunt]|Shal pen',
                      '*', sentence, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    print(purified) # Are you *? I* your uncle's. * you.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

> **Description:** There is a flags parameter in the regular expression related functions of the re module, which represents the matching flag of the regular expression. This flag can be used to specify whether to ignore case when matching and whether to perform multi-line matching. , whether to display debugging information, etc. If you need to specify multiple values ​​for the flags parameter, you can use the [bitwise OR operator](http://www.runoob.com/python/python-operators.html#ysf5) to superimpose, such as `flags=re.I | re.M`.

#### Example 4: Splitting a long string

````Python
import re


def main():
    poem = 'The bright moonlight in front of the window is suspected to be frost on the ground. Raise your head to look at the bright moon, and bow your head to think of your hometown. '
    sentence_list = re.split(r'[, ., .]', poem)
    while '' in sentence_list:
        sentence_list.remove('')
    print(sentence_list) # ['Moonlight in front of the window', 'Suspected of frost on the ground', 'Looking up at the bright moon', 'Looking down and thinking about hometown']


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

### Later

If you want to develop crawler applications, then regular expressions must be a very good assistant, because it can help us quickly find a certain pattern we specify from the web page code and extract the information we need. Of course, for the initial For scholars, it may not be easy to write a correct and appropriate regular expression (of course, some commonly used regular expressions can be found directly on the Internet), so when actually developing crawler applications, many people will Choose [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) or [Lxml](http://lxml.de/) for matching and information extraction, the former is simple and convenient but has poor performance , the latter is easy to use and has good performance, but it is a little troublesome to install. We will introduce these contents to you in the later crawler topic.
