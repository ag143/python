if i love you
The Ling Xiaohua who never learns to climb
Show yourself off with your tall branches

if i love you
Never learn infatuated birds
repeating monotonous songs for shade

more than a fountain
Bringing cool comfort all year round
More than just like a dangerous peak
Increase your height, set off your majesty
even sunlight, even spring rain
no these are not enough
I must be a kapok next to you
Standing with you as a tree image
root clenched in the ground
leaves touch in the cloud
every gust of wind
we all greet each other
But no one understands our words
you have your copper sticks
Like a knife, like a sword, like a halberd;
I have my red flowers
Like a heavy sigh and like a heroic torch
We share the cold wave, wind and thunder, thunderbolt
We share the haze, the haze, the rainbow
It's as if we're separated forever, but forever
This is great love
Perseverance is here
Love not only loves your stalwart body
I also love where you stand, the land under your feet
