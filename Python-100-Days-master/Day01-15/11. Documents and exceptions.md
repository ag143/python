## files and exceptions

[Persistence] of data is often encountered in actual development (https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%8C%81%E4%B9% 85%E5%8C%96) operation scenarios, and the most direct and simple way to achieve data persistence is to save the data to a file. When it comes to the word "file", you may need to first learn about the [file system] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%E7%B3%BB% E7%BB%9F) knowledge, but here we do not waste pen and ink to introduce this concept, please understand by yourself through Wikipedia.

Implementing file read and write operations in Python is actually very simple. Through the built-in `open` function in Python, we can specify the file name, operation mode, encoding information, etc. to obtain the object to operate the file, and then we can read and write the file. done. The operation mode mentioned here refers to what kind of file to open (character file or binary file) and what kind of operation to do (read, write or append), as shown in the following table.

| Operation Mode | Specific Meaning |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `'r'` | read (default) |
| `'w'` | write (truncates the previous content first) |
| `'x'` | write, raise exception if file already exists |
| `'a'` | Append, write content to the end of an existing file |
| `'b'` | binary mode |
| `'t'` | text mode (default) |
| `'+'` | Update (both read and write) |

The following picture comes from the [Rookie Tutorial](http://www.runoob.com) website, which shows how to set the operation mode according to the needs of the application.

### Read and write text files

When reading a text file, you need to specify the file name with the path when using the `open` function (you can use a relative path or an absolute path) and set the file mode to `'r'` (if not specified, the default value is also ` 'r'`), and then specify the encoding through the `encoding` parameter (if not specified, the default value is None, then the operating system default encoding is used when reading the file), if the encoding method used when saving the file cannot be guaranteed If the encoding method is the same as that specified by the encoding parameter, the reading may fail because the characters cannot be decoded. The following example demonstrates how to read a plain text file.

````Python
def main():
    f = open('To oak.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8')
    print(f.read())
    f.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

Note that in the above code, if the file specified by the `open` function does not exist or cannot be opened, an exception condition will be thrown and the program will crash. In order to make the code somewhat robust and fault-tolerant, we can use Python's exception mechanism to appropriately handle the code that may occur at runtime, as shown below.

````Python
def main():
    f = None
    try:
        f = open('To oak.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8')
        print(f.read())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print('Cannot open the specified file!')
    except LookupError:
        print('An unknown encoding was specified!')
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        print('Error decoding when reading file!')
    finally:
        if f:
            f.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

In Python, we can place code that may have conditions at runtime in a `try` block, followed by one or more `except` to catch possible exceptions. situation. For example, in the process of reading the file above, a `FileNotFoundError` will be raised if the file is not found, a `LookupError` will be raised if an unknown encoding is specified, and a `UnicodeDecodeError` will be raised if the file cannot be decoded in the specified way. `try` is followed by three `except` to handle these three different exception conditions. Finally, we use the `finally` code block to close the opened file and release the external resources acquired in the program, because the code in the `finally` block will be executed regardless of whether the program is normal or abnormal (even if the `exit` of the `sys` module is called) `The function exits the Python environment, and the `finally` block will be executed, because the `exit` function essentially raises the `SystemExit` exception), so we usually call the `finally` block "always execute code block", it is the most It is suitable for operations that release external resources. If you are not willing to close the file object in the `finally` code block to release resources, you can also use the context syntax to specify the context environment of the file object through the `with` keyword and automatically release the file resources when leaving the context environment, the code is as follows.

````Python
def main():
    try:
        with open('tooak.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            print(f.read())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print('Cannot open the specified file!')
    except LookupError:
        print('An unknown encoding was specified!')
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        print('Error decoding when reading file!')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

In addition to reading the file using the `read` method of the file object, you can also use the `for-in` loop to read line by line or the `readlines` method to read the file line by line into a list container, the code is as follows .

````Python
import time


def main():
    # Read the entire file content at once
    with open('tooak.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        print(f.read())

    # Read line by line through a for-in loop
    with open('To Oak.txt', mode='r') as f:
        for line in f:
            print(line, end='')
            time.sleep(0.5)
    print()

    # Read the file into a list line by line
    with open('to oak.txt') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    print(lines)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

Writing text information to a file is also very simple, specifying the file name and setting the file mode to `'w'` when using the `open` function. Note that mode should be set to `'a'` if appending to the file contents is desired. If the file to be written does not exist, the file is automatically created instead of throwing an exception. The following example demonstrates how to write the prime numbers between 1-9999 into three files respectively (the prime numbers between 1-99 are stored in a.txt, the prime numbers between 100-999 are stored in b.txt, Prime numbers between 1000-9999 are stored in c.txt).

````Python
from math import sqrt


def is_prime(n):
    """The function for determining prime numbers"""
    assert n > 0
    for factor in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % factor == 0:
            return False
    return True if n != 1 else False


def main():
    filenames = ('a.txt', 'b.txt', 'c.txt')
    fs_list = []
    try:
        for filename in filenames:
            fs_list.append(open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8'))
        for number in range(1, 10000):
            if is_prime(number):
                if number < 100:
                    fs_list[0].write(str(number) + '\n')
                elif number < 1000:
                    fs_list[1].write(str(number) + '\n')
                else:
                    fs_list[2].write(str(number) + '\n')
    except IOError as ex:
        print(ex)
        print('An error occurred while writing the file!')
    finally:
        for fs in fs_list:
            fs.close()
    print('Operation completed!')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

### Read and write binary files

Knowing how to read and write text files is very simple to read and write binary files. The following code implements the function of copying image files.

````Python
def main():
    try:
        with open('guido.jpg', 'rb') as fs1:
            data = fs1.read()
            print(type(data)) # <class 'bytes'>
        with open('guido.jpg', 'wb') as fs2:
            fs2.write(data)
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print('The specified file cannot be opened.')
    except IOError as e:
        print('An error occurred while reading and writing the file.')
    print('Program execution ends.')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

### Read and write JSON files

Through the above explanation, we already know how to save text data and binary data to a file, so here is another question, what if you want to save the data in a list or a dictionary to a file? The answer is to save the data in JSON format. JSON is the abbreviation of "JavaScript Object Notation". It was originally a literal syntax for creating objects in the JavaScript language. Now it has been widely used in cross-platform and cross-language data exchange. The reason is very simple, because JSON is also plain text. Any system or any programming language has no problem processing plain text. Currently JSON has basically replaced XML as the de facto standard for exchanging data between heterogeneous systems. For more knowledge about JSON, you can refer to [JSON official website] (http://json.org), from this website you can also learn about the tools or third-party libraries that each language can use to process JSON data format, the following is A simple example of JSON.

````JSON
{
    "name": "Luo Hao",
    "age": 38,
    "qq": 957658,
    "friends": ["Wang Dachui", "Bai Yuanfang"],
    "cars": [
        {"brand": "BYD", "max_speed": 180},
        {"brand": "Audi", "max_speed": 280},
        {"brand": "Benz", "max_speed": 320}
    ]
}
````

You may have noticed that the above JSON is actually the same as the dictionary in Python. In fact, the data type of JSON and the data type of Python are easy to find the corresponding relationship, as shown in the following two tables.

| JSON | Python |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| object | dict |
| array | list |
| string | str |
| number (int / real) | int / float |
| true / false | True / False |
| null | None |

| Python | JSON |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- -- |
| dict | object |
| list, tuple | array |
| str | string |
| int, float, int- & float-derived Enums | number |
|True/False|true/false|
| None | null |

We can use the json module in Python to save a dictionary or list to a file in JSON format. The code is as follows.

````Python
import json


def main():
    mydict = {
        'name': 'Luo Hao',
        'age': 38,
        'qq': 957658,
        'friends': ['Wang Dachui', 'Bai Yuanfang'],
        'cars': [
            {'brand': 'BYD', 'max_speed': 180},
            {'brand': 'Audi', 'max_speed': 280},
            {'brand': 'Benz', 'max_speed': 320}
        ]
    }
    try:
        with open('data.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as fs:
            json.dump(mydict, fs)
    except IOError as e:
        print(e)
    print('Complete saving data!')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

The json module mainly has four more important functions, namely:

- `dump` - serialize a Python object to a file in JSON format
- `dumps` - Dump Python objects into JSON-formatted strings
- `load` - Deserialize JSON data in a file into an object
- `loads` - Deserialize the contents of a string into a Python object

There are two concepts here, one is called serialization and the other is called deserialization. The free encyclopedia [Wikipedia] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/) explains these two concepts as follows: "Serialization, in computer science data processing, refers to the Or the object state is converted into a form that can be stored or transmitted, so that the original state can be restored when needed, and when the bytes are retrieved from the serialized data, these bytes can be used to produce a copy (copy) of the original object . The opposite of this process, the operation of extracting a data structure from a sequence of bytes, is deserialization."

At present, most network data services (or network APIs) are based on the [HTTP protocol] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B6%85%E6%96%87%E6% 9C%AC%E4%BC%A0%E8%BE%93%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE) provides data in JSON format. For the relevant knowledge of the HTTP protocol, you can see Teacher Ruan Yifeng's [" Introduction to HTTP Protocol"](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2016/08/http.html), if you want to know about domestic network data services, you can look at [Aggregated Data](https://www. juhe.cn/) and [Avatardata](http://www.avatardata.cn/) and other websites, foreigners can look at the [{API}Search](http://apis.io/) website. The following example demonstrates how to use the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/zh_CN/latest/) module (a well-packaged third-party network access module) to access the network API to obtain domestic news. The json module parses the JSON data and displays the news headlines. This example uses the domestic news data interface provided by [Tianxing Data](https://www.tianapi.com/), and the APIKey in it needs to be applied to the website by yourself.

````Python
import requests
import json


def main():
    resp = requests.get('http://api.tianapi.com/guonei/?key=APIKey&num=10')
    data_model = json.loads(resp.text)
    for news in data_model['newslist']:
        print(news['title'])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

To achieve serialization and deserialization in Python, in addition to using the json module, pickle and shelve modules can also be used, but these two modules use a unique serialization protocol to serialize data, so the serialized data is only Recognized by Python. For the relevant knowledge of these two modules, you can look at the information on the Internet by yourself. In addition, if you want to know more about the Python exception mechanism, you can read the article above by segmentfault ["Summary: Exception Handling in Python"](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000007736783), this article It not only introduces the use of the exception mechanism in Python, but also summarizes a series of best practices, which is worth reading.
