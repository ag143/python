## Graphical User Interface and Game Development

### GUI based on tkinter module

GUI is the abbreviation of Graphical User Interface, and the graphical user interface should be familiar to anyone who has used a computer, so there is no need to describe it here. Python's default GUI development module is tkinter (named Tkinter in versions prior to Python 3). From the name, it can be seen that it is based on Tk, a toolkit originally designed for Tcl and later ported Like many other scripting languages, it provides cross-platform GUI controls. Of course, Tk is not the latest and best choice, nor does it have a particularly powerful GUI control. In fact, developing GUI applications is not what Python is best at. If you really need to use Python to develop GUI applications, wxPython, PyQt, PyGTK, etc. Modules are a good choice.

Basically, using tkinter to develop GUI applications requires the following 5 steps:

1. Import what we need in the tkinter module.
2. Create a top-level window object and use it to host the entire GUI application.
3. Add GUI components on top-level window objects.
4. Organize the functions of these GUI components through code.
5. Enter the main event loop (main loop).

The following code demonstrates how to use tkinter to make a simple GUI application.

````Python
import tkinter
import tkinter.messagebox


def main():
    flag = True

    # modify the text on the label
    def change_label_text():
        nonlocal flag
        flag = not flag
        color, msg = ('red', 'Hello, world!')\
            if flag else ('blue', 'Goodbye, world!')
        label.config(text=msg, fg=color)

    # confirm exit
    def confirm_to_quit():
        if tkinter.messagebox.askokcancel('Warm reminder', 'Are you sure you want to quit?'):
            top.quit()

    # create top-level window
    top = tkinter.Tk()
    # set window size
    top.geometry('240x160')
    # set the window title
    top.title('mini game')
    # Create a label object and add it to the top-level window
    label = tkinter.Label(top, text='Hello, world!', font='Arial -32', fg='red')
    label.pack(expand=1)
    # Create a container for the button
    panel = tkinter.Frame(top)
    # Create a button object, specify which container to add to, and bind the event callback function through the command parameter
    button1 = tkinter.Button(panel, text='modify', command=change_label_text)
    button1.pack(side='left')
    button2 = tkinter.Button(panel, text='quit', command=confirm_to_quit)
    button2.pack(side='right')
    panel.pack(side='bottom')
    # Start the main event loop
    tkinter.mainloop()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

It should be noted that GUI applications are usually event-driven. The reason for entering the main event loop is to monitor the occurrence of various events such as mouse and keyboard and execute the corresponding code to process the events, because events will continue to occur. So you need such a loop running all the time waiting for the next event to happen. On the other hand, Tk provides three layout managers for the placement of controls, through which the controls can be positioned. These three layout managers are: Placer (the developer provides the size and placement of the controls) , Packer (automatically fills the controls to the appropriate position), and Grid (places controls based on grid coordinates), which will not be described here.

### Game development with Pygame

Pygame is an open source Python module dedicated to the development of multimedia applications (such as video games), which includes support for images, sound, video, events, collisions, and more. Pygame is built on the basis of [SDL](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDL), SDL is a set of cross-platform multimedia development library, implemented in C language, which is widely used in games and simulators , the development of players, etc. Pygame allows game developers to no longer be bound by the underlying language, and can pay more attention to the functions and logic of the game.

Next, let's complete a simple little game. The name of the game is "Big Ball Eats Small Ball". Of course, completing this game is not the point, and learning to use Pygame is not the point. The most important thing is that we need to understand how to use the front Explain object-oriented programming and learn to use this programming idea to solve real-world problems.

#### Make game window

````Python
import pygame


def main():
    # Initialize imported modules in pygame
    pygame.init()
    # Initialize the window for display and set the window size
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
    # Set the title of the current window
    pygame.display.set_caption('big ball eats small ball')
    running = True
    # Start an event loop to handle events that occur
    while running:
        # Get events from the message queue and process them
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

#### Drawing in the window

You can draw on the window through the function of the draw module in pygame. The graphics that can be drawn include: lines, rectangles, polygons, circles, ellipses, arcs, etc. It should be noted that the screen coordinate system is to set the upper left corner of the screen as the coordinate origin `(0, 0)`, the right direction is the positive direction of the x-axis, and the downward direction is the positive direction of the y-axis. At this time, our default unit is [pixel](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%83%8F%E7%B4%A0). The so-called pixel is a point on the screen. You can use the software for browsing pictures to try to enlarge a picture several times, and you can see these points. In pygame, the color is represented by the color light [three primary colors] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8E%9F%E8%89%B2) notation, that is, through a tuple or list to specify the color The RGB value of , each value is between 0 and 255, because each primary color is represented by an 8-bit (bit) value, and the three colors are equivalent to a total of 24 bits, which is often said "24-bit color representation".

````Python
import pygame


def main():
    # Initialize imported modules in pygame
    pygame.init()
    # Initialize the window for display and set the window size
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
    # Set the title of the current window
    pygame.display.set_caption('big ball eats small ball')
    # Set the background color of the window (color is a tuple of red, green and blue primary colors)
    screen.fill((242, 242, 242))
    # Draw a circle (parameters are: screen, color, center position, radius, 0 means filled circle)
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 0, 0,), (100, 100), 30, 0)
    # Refresh the current window (the rendering window will render the drawn image)
    pygame.display.flip()
    running = True
    # Start an event loop to handle events that occur
    while running:
        # Get events from the message queue and process them
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

#### Load image

If you need to directly load the image to the window, you can use the function of the image module in pygame to load the image, and then render the image through the `blit` method of the window object obtained earlier. The code is as follows.

````Python
import pygame


def main():
    # Initialize imported modules in pygame
    pygame.init()
    # Initialize the window for display and set the window size
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
    # Set the title of the current window
    pygame.display.set_caption('big ball eats small ball')
    # Set the background color of the window (color is a tuple of red, green and blue primary colors)
    screen.fill((255, 255, 255))
    # Load the image with the specified filename
    ball_image = pygame.image.load('./res/ball.png')
    # render the image on the window
    screen.blit(ball_image, (50, 50))
    # Refresh the current window (the rendering window will render the drawn image)
    pygame.display.flip()
    running = True
    # Start an event loop to handle events that occur
    while running:
        # Get events from the message queue and process them
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

#### Implement animation effects

When it comes to [animation](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%A8%E7%94%BB), the word is familiar to everyone. In fact, to achieve animation effect, the principle itself is also It is very simple, that is, the discontinuous pictures are played continuously, as long as a certain number of frames per second is reached, then a relatively smooth animation effect can be made. If you want to make the ball in the above code move, you can use a variable to represent the position of the ball, modify the position of the ball in the loop, and then refresh the entire window.

````Python
import pygame


def main():
    # Initialize imported modules in pygame
    pygame.init()
    # Initialize the window for display and set the window size
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
    # Set the title of the current window
    pygame.display.set_caption('big ball eats small ball')
    # Define variables to represent the position of the ball on the screen
    x, y = 50, 50
    running = True
    # Start an event loop to handle events that occur
    while running:
        # Get events from the message queue and process them
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        screen.fill((255, 255, 255))
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 0, 0,), (x, y), 30, 0)
        pygame.display.flip()
        # Change the position of the ball every 50ms and refresh the window
        pygame.time.delay(50)
        x, y = x + 5, y + 5


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

#### Impact checking

Usually there will be many objects in a game, and the "collision" between these objects is inevitable, such as the shell hits the plane, the box hits the ground, etc. Collision detection is a crucial issue that must be dealt with in most games. The sprite (animation sprite) module of pygame provides support for collision detection. Here we will not introduce the functions provided by the sprite module for the time being. Because it is very simple to detect whether two balls collide, just check whether the distance between the centers of the balls is less than the sum of the radii of the two balls. In order to create more balls, we can create balls with random color, size and movement speed at the position where the mouse is clicked by processing mouse events. Of course, to do this, we can use what we learned before. Object-oriented knowledge is applied.

    RED = (255, 0, 0)

        g = randint(0, 255)
        b = randint(0, 255)
        return (r, g, b)


class Ball(object):
    """球"""

    def __init__(self, x, y, radius, sx, sy, color=Color.RED):
        """初始化方法"""
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.radius = radius
        self.sx = sx
        self.sy = sy
        self.color = color
        self.alive = True

    def move(self, screen):
        """移动"""
        self.x += self.sx
        self.y += self.sy
        if self.x - self.radius <= 0 or \
                self.x + self.radius >= screen.get_width():
            self.sx = -self.sx
        if self.y - self.radius <= 0 or \
                self.y + self.radius >= screen.get_height():
            self.sy = -self.sy

    def eat(self, other):
        """吃其他球"""
        if self.alive and other.alive and self != other:
            dx, dy = self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y
            distance = sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2)
            if distance < self.radius + other.radius \
                    and self.radius > other.radius:
                other.alive = False
                self.radius = self.radius + int(other.radius * 0.146)

    def draw(self, screen):
        """在窗口上绘制球"""
        pygame.draw.circle(screen, self.color,
                           (self.x, self.y), self.radius, 0)
```

#### event handling

Mouse events can be processed in the event loop. The event type can be determined through the `type` property of the event object, and then the position of the mouse click can be obtained through the `pos` property. If you want to handle keyboard events, it is also in this place, similar to handling mouse events.

````Python
def main():
    # Define the container to hold all the balls
    balls = []
    # Initialize imported modules in pygame
    pygame.init()
    # Initialize the window for display and set the window size
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
    # Set the title of the current window
    pygame.display.set_caption('big ball eats small ball')
    running = True
    # Start an event loop to handle events that occur
    while running:
        # Get events from the message queue and process them
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
            # code to handle mouse events
            if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and event.button == 1:
                # Get the position of the mouse click
                x, y = event.pos
                radius = randint(10, 100)
                sx, sy = randint(-10, 10), randint(-10, 10)
                color = Color.random_color()
                # Create a ball at the mouse click position (random size, speed and color)
                ball = Ball(x, y, radius, sx, sy, color)
                # Add the ball to the list container
                balls.append(ball)
        screen.fill((255, 255, 255))
        # Take the ball out of the container, draw it if it is not eaten, and remove it if it is eaten
        for ball in balls:
            if ball.alive:
                ball.draw(screen)
            else:
                balls.remove(ball)
        pygame.display.flip()
        # Change the position of the ball every 50ms and refresh the window
        pygame.time.delay(50)
        for ball in balls:
            ball.move(screen)
            # Check if the ball has eaten other balls
            for other in balls:
                ball.eat(other)

Combining the above two pieces of code, we have completed the game of "big ball eats small ball" (as shown in the figure below). To be precise, it is not a game, but we have passed the basic knowledge of making a small game. This example tells everyone that with this knowledge, you can start your small game development journey. In fact, there are still many areas worth improving in the above code. For example, the code for refreshing the window and moving the ball should not be placed in the event loop. After learning the knowledge of multi-threading, it may be possible to use a background thread to handle these things. is the better choice. If you want to get a better user experience, we can also add background music to the game and play sound effects when the ball collides with the ball. Using pygame's mixer and music modules, we can easily do this, you can do it yourself Learn about this. In fact, if you want to know more about pygame, the best tutorial is [pygame's official website](https://www.pygame.org/news). If your English is fine, you can go and see it. If you want to develop [3D games](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D%E6%B8%B8%E6%88%8F), pygame seems powerless.
